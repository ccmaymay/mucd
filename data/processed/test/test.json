AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, GOLCHER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY U.S. MILITARY ATTACHE ANGEL MENENDEZ. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AT 0100 ON 26 AUGUST AT THE INTERSECTION OF WEST 1ST STREET AND NORTH 51ST AVENUE. COL GOLCHER WAS SUPPOSEDLY IN ISRAEL WHERE HE WAS SENT AS THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT'S MILITARY ATTACHE; HOWEVER, THE WELL-KNOWN LEADER OF THE DEATH SQUADS WAS SEEN AT 0100 IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR ACCOMPANIED BY NONE OTHER THAN THE U.S. MILITARY REPRESENTATIVE IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS HAPPENED ONLY HOURS AFTER COLONEL (ADOLFO ARNOLDO) MAJANO'S BODYGUARDS WERE MURDERED. THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THIS INCIDENT RAISE SEVERAL QUESTIONS. WHAT WERE THESE TWO SOLDIERS DOING AT 0100? WHERE WERE GOLCHER'S BODYGUARDS? WHERE WERE HIS COMPANION'S BODYGUARDS? THE TWO MEN WERE PROBABLY RETURNING FROM A CORRUPTION CENTER, A NIGHT CLUB--ONE OF THOSE EXCLUSIVE CLUBS WHERE THE U.S. ADVISERS AND OTHER U.S. AND SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SPEND THE DOLLARS THEY STEAL FROM THE FUNDS ALLOTTED TO EL SALVADOR AND WHERE THEY PLAN CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE. MUCH MORE COULD BE SAID; HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NO MERE ACCIDENT. MRS PLATERO IS ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE MADNESS AFFECTING AN ARMY DIRECTED BY U.S. ADVISERS. THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS INCIDENT AND THE HURLING OF A GRENADE BY A SOLDIER DRIVEN CRAZY BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TERRORISM PRACTICED BY THE ARMY ADVISERS AND CHIEFS. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT GOLCHER WILL NOT BE TRIED FOR THIS NEW CRIME, JUST AS HE HAS NOT BEEN TRIED FOR THE MANY CRIMES HE HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR AS CHIEF OF THE REPRESSIVE CORPS AND DEATH SQUADS.",

        "text": "DEAR MR PRESIDENT: ON THE ROAD TOWARD ACHIEVING PEACE, WE HAVE OFTEN EXPERIENCED SETBACKS AND DIFFICULT TIMES. POWERFUL FORCES ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY VIOLENCE AND WAR EVERY TIME DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS OR COMMITMENTS ARE NOT FOLLOWED OR MET. WHEN THERE IS AN ARMED STRUGGLE AND WHEN THOUSANDS ARE KILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELD, THOSE WHO PROMOTE VIOLENCE NEVER CONCLUDE FROM THOSE USELESS KILLINGS THAT WAR IS FUTILE. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION. IT WILL ALWAYS BE EASIER TO RECTIFY MISTAKES WHEN THE WEAKNESSES ARE POLITICAL OR WHEN ERRORS ARE MADE ON THE ROAD TO PEACE. WE CANNOT BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE, AND VIOLENCE BORN OF HATRED TAKES A LONG TIME TO HEAL. I BELIEVE, MR PRESIDENT, THAT IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING IF YOU WERE TO RECTIFY SOME POLITICAL DECISIONS YOUR GOVERNMENT MADE FOLLOWING THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS AT NANDAIME. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REOPEN THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA THAT ARE CLOSED. IT IS NECESSARY TO RELEASE THE PRISONERS AND TO REVOKE THE SENTENCES IMPOSED UPON THEM AS PUNISHMENT FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE INCIDENTS. THE PEACE PLAN TO WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED OBLIGES US TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OUR MOST SACRED COMMITMENT IS TO CONTINUE PROGRESSING ON THE PATH TOWARD DEMOCRATIZATION. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS RESUME NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE A PERMANENT END TO MILITARY ACTIONS IN NICARAGUA. THIS COULD VERY WELL BE AN ENCOURAGING EXAMPLE FOR MANY CENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. I OFFER YOU OUR COSTA RICAN TERRITORY FOR THE RESUMPTION OF SUCH NEGOTIATIONS. I ALSO OFFER YOU ALL THE ASSISTANCE WITHIN MY MEANS TO ENABLE SUCH NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKE PLACE. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL ATTEND THE UPCOMING INAUGURAL CEREMONY IN ECUADOR. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF PEACE, A NOBLE GESTURE TOWARD RODRIGO BORJA, AND WOULD AID IN STRENGTHENING THE ECUADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IF YOU ATTENDED THE CEREMONY IN QUITO AFTER REVERSING THE SETBACKS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANTIDEMOCRATIC ACTIONS, SUCH AS PENALIZING THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA AND DEPRIVING MEN AND WOMEN OF THEIR LIBERTY. ONLY IF WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CORRECT OUR MISTAKES AND THE VISION TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH OUTLINED IN THE PEACE PLAN CAN CENTRAL AMERICANS PREVENT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR PEOPLES. A LATIN AMERICAN COMMITMENT TO PEACE ALSO REQUIRES EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY. WE WILL NOT BE GRANTED ANOTHER POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO FORGE HISTORY. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR RECONCILIATION TO ALLOW TODAY'S YOUTH A DIFFERENT FUTURE, A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ASIDE THEIR WEAPONS AND TO WORK FOR A BETTER FUTURE.",

THE JUDGEMENT PRESENTED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT NOTES THAT THIS WITNESS HAS MADE STATEMENTS THAT CONTRADICT TESTIMONY HE GAVE AT THE 4TH CRIMINAL COURT 7 YEARS AFTER THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED. FOR THIS REASON, THE JUDGE, BASED ON ARTICLES 497 AND 498 OF THE PENAL CODE AND ARTICLE 53 OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURES LAW HAS RULED THAT THERE IS NO MERIT FOR ARRESTING THE MILITARY MAN, WHO HAS BEEN TRIED IN ABSENTIA. HOWEVER, COURT OFFICIALS HAVE EXPLAINED THAT THIS DOCUMENT ISSUED BY JUDGE AURORA IS ONLY A REPORT ON HIS RULING, WHICH ACCORDING TO THE LAW CAN BE EITHER REVOKED OR CONFIRMED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.

        "text": "INTERIOR, MIGRATION, AND JUSTICE MINISTER JUAN CARLOS DURAN HAS SAID THAT SINCE 1985 PRESIDENT VICTOR PAZ ESTENSSORO'S ADMINISTRATION MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOLIVIAN SOCIETY. THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS OBTAINED GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFIKING BY ELIMINATING 80 PERCENT OF THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. DURAN SAID THAT DURING PAZ' ADMINISTRATION ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE CONNECTED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, 1,000 COCAINE LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, AND 20 TONS OF DRUGS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED. HE SAID THAT BOLIVIAN SOCIETY HAS WITNESSED THESE ACHIEVEMENTS AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT TO ERADICATE DRUG TRAFFICKING FROM THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. THE INTERIOR MINISTER EXPRESSED GREAT ANNOYANCE AT AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED BY THE NEWSPAPER EL PAIS, OF MADRID, SPAIN, IN WHICH FELIPE KEMPFF, SON OF THE MURDERED BOLIVIAN SCIENTIST NOEL KEMPFF, ASSERTS THAT THE BOLIVIAN AND U.S. GOVERNMENTS ALLOW THE MANUFACTURING OF COCAINE AND USE THE PROCEDES TO FINANCE THE INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM. DURAN SAID: \"I WILL ASK THE DISTRICT PROSECUTOR TO SUMMON FELIPE KEMPFF TO COURT IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM TELL EVERYTHING HE KNOWS. HE MUST SAY TO WHOM THE COCAINE LABORATORIES BELONG, HOW MUCH DRUG IT CAN PROCESS, AND WHOM IT BENEFITS.\" AFTER FELIPE KEMPFF REPORTED THE ALLEGED EXISTENCE OF A SECOND COCAINE LABORATORY IN HUANCHACA, THE SPECIAL ANTINARCOTICS FORCES RAIDED THE AREA FOR 15 DAYS AND WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY OTHER LABORATORY EXCEPT FOR ONE THAT WAS DISMANTLED IN 1986, MINISTER DURAN SAID.",

        "text": "THE PLAN INCLUDED SEVERAL POINTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN WAS TO PRESSURE GENERAL NORIEGA TO RESIGN FROM HIS MILITARY POST IN LATE AUGUST. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLAN WERE: TO INTENSIFY AND SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA WITHIN THE FDP; TO INTENSIFY AND SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA'S COLLABORATORS BY MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN COLLABORATORS THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NORIEGA ALLIES, PARTICULARLY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, ESPECIALLY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS THAT DEALT WITH NORIEGA, SUCH AS THE FMLN AND THE M-19, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; AND TO MOVE THE ANTI-NORIEGA SECTOR WITHIN THE FDP TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC ACTIONS AGAINST NORIEGA'S REGIME. THE FDP MEMBERS, OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WERE THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN. WE SEE HOW SOME WERE TAKEN IN BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS PLAN. THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN WERE GEN NORIEGA, NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN COLLABORATORS WITHIN THE FDP, SOME CIVILIANS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE NORIEGA'S ALLIES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, AND FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH NORIEGA. THEY IDENTIFIED ALL OF NORIEGA'S VULNERABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE VULNERABILITIES OF ALL THE TARGETS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED. THERE WERE CERTAIN THEMES USED IN THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS, AND THE MEDIA FELL FOR THEM MANY TIMES. THIS IS WHY WE REPEATEDLY ASKED THEM NOT TO FALL FOR THIS MISINFORMATION. THESE THEMES INCLUDED: BY IMPOSING HIS ARBITRARY NATURE AND CORRUPTION, NORIEGA IS PERVERTING THE FDP AND PROMOTING THE DISINTEGRATION OF THAT MILITARY INSTITUTION. THE FDP HAVE BECOME A MAFIA THAT IS HEADING TOWARD DISGRACE. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN LEAFLETS AND MANY PUBLICATIONS. BY DISRUPTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AT HIS WHIM, NORIEGA IS PROVOKING A PROFOUND SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS THAT IS RUINING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DONE TO HIDE THOSE WHO ARE TRULY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LONGER NORIEGA REMAINS IN POWER, THE MORE PROBABLE BECOMES A U.S., CUBAN, OR SOVIET INTERVENTION. THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS PROVOKED BY NORIEGA NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF THE FDP MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. NORIEGA'S FALL IS INEVITABLE AND THE FDP SHOULD NOT FALL WITH HIM. TO SAVE THE FDP AND THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, THE FDP MUST REMOVE NORIEGA FROM OFFICE. THIS IS WHY THERE WERE SIREN SONGS THAT AN INTERNAL COUP WAS UNDER WAY. THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE FOR 5 MONTHS AND WE KNOW THE FUGITIVES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOW WHERE THEY LEFT FROM. NO ONE CAN DENY THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN U.S. CITIZENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION WITH THE PANAMANIAN GROUPS THAT WERE CAPTURED. WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, THE WEAPONS, THE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR MISINFORMATION, THE PLANS, AND THE MAPS WITH THE TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE. IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE KIDNAPPED HAD ALSO BEEN MARKED ON THESE MAPS. THEY HAD MARKED THE BRIDGES THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED. GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW THE POWER OF WEAPONS AND WE KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. WE KNOW THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO. THEREFORE, BEFORE THERE WAS A VIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR FDP, WE WENT ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEIR PLANS. IF ARRESTS WERE MADE, IT WAS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH INEXPERIENCED GROUPS THAT ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE USED FOR THE PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED, WITH A SIREN SONG, THE PROMISE OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE'S $30 MILLION THAT ERIC ARTURO DELVALLE WAS GOING TO USE FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTS, BLOODY ACTS TO BATHE OUR PEOPLE IN BLOOD, AS IN THE CASE OF THE STRUGGLE OF OUR BROTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AND CENTRAL AMERICA. WE WILL NOT PERMIT THAT. THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO GO ONE STEP AHEAD AND FOIL THESE PLANS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND THAT WOULD RESULT IN MOURNING AND PAIN FOR PANAMANIAN FAMILIES. WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE DAMN WELL ARRESTED: ALBERTO CONTE, FRED BOYD, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES SO EDUARDO HERRERA AND FRIENDS CAN LIVE LIKE KINGS IN THE UNITED STATETS, SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES DRINKING CHAMPAGNE AND EATING PHEASANT. EDUARDO HERRERA WAS DISMISSED FROM A DIPLOMATIC POST FOR SMUGGLING 40 BOXES OF WHISKEY PER WEEK INTO ISRAEL. HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON PROTECTED BY THE PENTAGON AND ELLIOTT ABRAMS. HE IS ELLIOTT ABRAMS' HERO. THERESA WELLINGTON OF THE (U.S.) EMBASSY IN MEXICO, WHO GAVE THESE PEOPLE--WHO LEFT PANAMA FOR MEXICO-- THEIR VISAS IN 10 MINUTES BY ABRAMS' ORDERS, HAS ALSO BECOME ONE OF OUR PEOPLE'S ENEMIES.

THE PDC'S PREMISES ARE LOCATED AT 683 SOTOMAYOR STREET, IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF THE CITY. THE IDENTITY OF THE ATTACKERS IS UNKNOWN. THE REPORT WAS FILED BY FORMER CONGRESSMAN HUMBERTO BALZA, THE PRESIDENT OF THE PDC'S LOCAL CHAPTER, WHO HAS ALSO RECEIVED DEATH THREATS IN THE PAST FEW HOURS. THIS IS WHAT BALZA TOLD RADIO CHILENA'S \"PRIMERA PLANA\" FEATURE: (BALZA) (BEGIN RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS ATTACKED THE PDC'S PREMISES, LOCATED AT 683 SOTOMAYOR STREET, BREAKING THE WINDOWS OF THE PREMISES AND TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR. LUCKILY, OUR GUARD WENT OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THE ATTACKERS TOOK OFF, LEAVING ABUNDANT YES-VOTE PROPAGANDA WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE CANDIDATE. THE ATTACKERS ALSO SHOUTED THREATS AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY'S BOARD. WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD THE ARICA PUBLIC, BUT NOW WE WANT ALL OF THE CHILEAN PUBLIC TO KNOW, THAT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE YES-VOTE ARE DESPERATE, BECAUSE THEY SEE THERE ARE NOW MORE NO-VOTE SUPPORTERS THAN YES-VOTE SUPPORTERS. THIS IS WHY THE LATTER ARE THREATENING PEOPLE, WHY THEY ARE TRYING TO STEAL IDENTITY CARDS, AND WHY THEY ARE RESORTIG TO ANY TYPE OF ACTION THAT WILL CREATE UNREST IN ORDER TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO THE SUPPORTERS OF THE YES-VOTE AND TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE FOR ANY TYPE OF ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON 5 OCTOBER.

        "text": "A TERRORIST ATTACK, IN WHICH CZECHOSLOVAK BOMBS WERE USED, HAS DESTROYED FOUR HIGH TENSION TOWERS IN THE CENTRAL REGION. THIS ATTACK HAS CUT THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY TO A VAST REGION BETWEEN COPIAPO AND SANTIAGO. THE BLACKOUT OCCURRED ON SATURDAY NIGHT, 1 OCTOBER, AND LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF HOUR IN THE METROPOLITAN REGION. ACCORDING TO ENDESA (NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER, INC.), ONE OF THE TOWERS KNOCKED DOWN WAS LOCATED ON KM 24 OF THE MELIPILLA-RAPEL HIGHWAY. THE TOWER, LOCATED IN THE MAITENES SECTOR, IS ONE OF THE MAIN TOWERS OF THE HIGH TENSION NETWORK. ANOTHER TOWER DESTROYED BY THE TERRORISTS WAS TOWER NO 430 IN THE ITAHUA-ALTO JAHUEL SECTOR, WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN ELECTRICITY NETWORK. IN ADDITION TO THESE FOUR DESTROYED TOWERS, OTHER EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD THAT SAME NIGHT IN SANTIAGO. THEY WERE CAUSED BY BOMBS PLANTED BY TERRORISTS WHO SEEK TO FRIGHTEN THE POPULATION. ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES, THE BOMBS USED TO CAUSE SO MUCH DAMAGE ARE POWERFUL CZECHOSLOVAK-MADE PLASTIC BOMBS, OF THE SAME TYPE THAT WERE FOUND AMONG THE CLANDESTINE ARSENALS SMUGGLED INTO THE COUNTRY BY THE MARXIST LEFTISTS AT CARRIZAL BAJO. THE TERRORISTS ALSO USED TNT IN THEIR BOMB ATTACKS.",

THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN ALTO DE SAN PABLO WHILE GASOLINE AND PROPANE GAS WERE BEING PUMPED TO BUCARAMANGA. WE HAVE A REPORT NOW FROM TERESA RUEDA. (BEGIN RECORDING) (RUEDA) COMMUNICATIONS TO AND FROM PUERTO PETROLERO AND BUCARAMANGA HAVE BEEN CUT OFF SINCE EARLY TODAY, AFTER AN ATTEMPT TO DYNAMITE THE MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE DESTROYED A 100-METER SECTION OF THE CENTRAL HIGHWAY. THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO BUCARAMANGA WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THIS EVENT. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST 3 DAYS TO RESTORE NORMAL TRAFFIC, BECAUSE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO USE DYNAMITE TO REMOVE ROCKS CURRENTLY BLOCKING THE HIGHWAY. THE ATTEMPTED SABOTAGE OCCURRED AT THE 65-KM MARK ON THE BUCARAMANGA - BARRANCABERMEJA HIGHWAY, 20 KM FROM THE PLACE WHERE A MILITARY CONVOY WAS AMBUSHED LAST WEDNESDAY. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT AN ATTEMPTED SABOTAGE OF THE BUCARAMANGA - BARRANCABERMEJA MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE, WHICH CARRIES PROPANE GAS, GASOLINE, AND ACPM (NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED) HAS TAKEN PLACE. THE EXPLOSION DESTROYED A 30-METER SECTION OF PIPELINE, AND SPARKED A FIRE THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN EXTINGUISHED. LOSSES CAUSED BY THE SABOTAGE, WHICH HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE ELN, HAVE YET TO BE ASCERTAINED. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT REPAIRS TO THE HIGHWAY ALONE WILL COST THE PUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY 5 MILLION PESOS. (ISMAEL OROZCO, PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR FOR THE 5TH DISTRICT) WELL, AFTER INITIAL TALKS WITH ECOPETROL (COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE) TECHNICIANS TODAY, BEGINNING AT 1700, AFTER THE FIRE IS UNDER CONTROL, THEY WILL BEGIN RESTORING SERVICE ON THE OIL PIPELINE. (RUEDA) AT THIS TIME, THERE IS TRAFFIC CONGESTION NEAR THE SUGAMOSO BRIDGE. (END RECORDING) (PASSAGE OMITTED) WHILE STILL ON THE SUBJECT, ECOPETROL'S PRESIDENT, WHO TRAVELED THIS MORNING TO BARRANCABERMEJA TO ATTEND A FORUM ON THE MAGDALENA RIVER, REPORTED THAT, SO FAR THIS YEAR, TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE COST HIS COMPANY $300 MILLION. WE HAVE THIS REPORT FROM MARIA CLARA GRACIA. (BEGIN RECORDING) (GRACIA) ECOPETROL HAS LOST 95 BILLION PESOS IN REVENUES THIS YEAR DUE TO THE 44 TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE CANO LIMON - COVENAS OIL PIPELINE. IN THESE ATTACKS, 13.2 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL HAVE BEEN LOST. THE AREAS MOST AFFECTED BY THESE ATTACKS ARE IN SUCRE, ARAUCA, NORTE DE SANTANDER, AND SANTANDER DEPARTMENTS. (REPORTER ALVARO AYALA) DOCTOR, COULD THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES IN COLOMBIA? (DR ANDRES RESTREPO LONDONO, PRESIDENT OF ECOPETROL) OBVIOUSLY, THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN, FACED WITH INCREASING INTERNAL PRODUCTION COSTS AND FALLING REVENUES, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER COMPENSATING OUR LOSSES WITH AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OIL PRICES, BUT THAT IS A MEASURE WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO ADOPT AT THIS TIME. (GRACIA) TODAY'S LANDSLIDE, WHICH DESTROYED A SECTION OF THE MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE BETWEEN BARRANCABERMEJA AND BUCARAMANGA, HAS RESULTED IN ESTIMATED LOSSES TOTALLING 1.435 BILLION PESOS.

THE REMAINING 17 POLICEMEN--TAKEN BY THE REBELS DURING AN ATTACK ON NORTHERN SAN PABLO MUNICIPALITY ON 5 OCTOBER--ARE STILL HELD BY THE REBELS.

APPROXIMATELY 30 HEAVILY ARMED TERRORISTS, INCLUDING 6 WOMEN, BLOCKED THE HIGHWAY WITH STONES AND TREE TRUNKS AT 0600 TO INTERCEPT A BUS OWNED BY THE LOBATO CO., ANOTHER BUS OWNED BY THE LOS ANDES CO., AND TWO TRUCKS LOADED WITH FRUIT AND LUMBER. THE VEHICLES WERE TRAVELING FROM SATIPO TO HUANCAYO. THE TERRORISTS MADE THE PASSENGERS GET OFF THE BUSES AND THEN EXAMINED THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS. FOUR OF THE PASSENGERS, WHO TURNED OUT TO BE ARMY MEMBERS DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES, WERE SEPARATED FROM THE GROUP. TWO OF THOSE IDENTIFIED AS SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IMMEDIATELY, WHILE THE OTHER TWO, APPARENTLY ARMY OFFICERS, WERE TAKEN AS HOSTAGES TOWARD ATALAYA, IN A MONTAINOUS REGION. (PASSAGE OMITTED)",

THE OUTBREAK OF THE VIOLENCE COINCIDED WITH THE REPLY FROM ALL THE REBEL GROUPS TO AN OFFICIAL PEACE PLAN AND WITH THE CONFIRMATION BY THE LABOR FEDERATIONS THAT THEY WILL HOLD A GENERAL STRIKE ON THURSDAY DESPITE GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT. THE SO-CALLED NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNG) PROPOSED TO PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO THE HOLDING OF A SUMMIT BETWEEN THE REBEL LEADERS AND THE GOVERNMENT, DEFENSE, AND ENERGY AND MINES MINISTERS AT A PLACE AND DATE TO BE AGREED UPON. THE DOCUMENT PROPOSED THAT THE MEDIATOR OF THE DIALOGUE BE THE DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE COMMISSION (COMISION DE CONVIVENCIA DEMOCRATICA), HEADED BY MSGR DARIO CASTRILLON, PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE. THE DOCUMENT IS VIEWED AS THE CNG'S OFFICIAL REPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE PLAN. GUERRILLAS OF THE FARC AND THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY (EPL) ATTACKED FOUR TOWNS IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA, LEAVING 17 GUERRILLAS AND 2 SOLDIERS DEAD AND 3 BRIDGES PARTIALLY DESTROYED. THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED THAT FARC GUERRILLAS AMBUSHED A MILITARY CONVOY IN HUILA DEPARTMENT, KILLING THREE SOLDIERS. IT ALSO REPORTED THAT THREE REBELS WERE KILLED IN CLASHES IN SOUTHERN COLOMBIA. IT ADDED THAT NINE GUERRILLAS OF THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION WERE KILLED IN CLASHES WITH TROOPS OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE ON THE BORDER OF ANTIOQUIA AND CHOCO DEPARTMENTS AND THAT SIX FARC REBELS WERE KILLED IN CAQUETA DEPARTMENT. SUSPECTED GUERRILLAS DYNAMITED AT DUSK A BRIDGE IN BOGOTA'S URBAN CENTER, INJURING SIX PEOPLE. THE BRIDGE DID NOT SUSTAIN MAJOR DAMAGE. ANOTHER BRIDGE WAS BLOWN UP IN SANTANDER DEPARTMENT. MILITARY SOURCES SAID THESE WERE REBEL ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE STRIKE AND THEY CHARGED THAT WORKERS, PEASANTS, AND BUS DRIVERS ARE BEING THREATENED TO FORCE THEM TO JOIN THE STRIKE. PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO HEADED A MEETING OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO ADOPT MEASURES TO PREVENT DISORDERS DURING THE PLANNED STRIKE AND TO GUARANTEE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FOR THE PEOPLE. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WORKERS YESTERDAY BROKE OFF THEIR TALKS AFTER BEING UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON AN INCREASE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND ON A FREEZE IN THE PRICES OF STAPLES. THE STRIKE, CALLED BY THE UNITED WORKERS CONFEDERATION AND THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF LABOR, WILL PROTEST THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT REPLIED TO LABOR DEMANDS THEY PRESENTED IN MAY.",

CAR BOMBS WENT OFF IN SUCH PLACES LATELY. THEY WENT OFF AT A CHAIN OF (WORDS INDISTINCT) AND AT A SHOPPING MALL. THE FMLN'S STRATEGY IS SIMPLY TO INCREASE ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS. FOR THAT REASON, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DESCRIBES THE FMLN AS A GROUP IN ARMS, BECAUSE THEY ARE MERELY TERRORIST CRIMINALS. (PASSAGE OMITTED) THERE IS POLITICAL WEAKNESS, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT GIVEN CLEAR MISSIONS. WE SEE THE ACTIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY CORPS ARE FRUSTRATED, BECAUSE THEY SPEND TIME, EFFORT, AND MEN CAPTURING TERRORISTS WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASES THEM FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS. I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT MUST APPLY THE LAWS MORE FORCEFULLY AND STOP DECEIVING THE POPULATION WITH WORDS SUCH AS DEMOCRATIZATION AND WITH ITS GREAT POLITICAL DEMAGOGY.

        "text": "THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR) WILL DEVELOP A NEW FORM OF STRUGGLE CALLED THE \"NATIONAL PATRIOTIC WAR,\" \"WHICH WILL START AT ANY MOMENT.\" THIS INFORMATION WAS DISCLOSED YESTERDAY TO EL MERCURIO BY FPMR SPOKESMAN VICTOR DIAZ CARO, WHO SAID THAT THE TRUCE DURING THE PLEBISCITE WAS TO PREPARE THE PHASE THEY ARE NOW STARTING. HE ALSO CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT IN BRUSSELS THIS WEEK BY FPMR INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN MARCELO REYES. DIAZ CARO, WHO HAS CONFESSED TO BEING ONE OF THE SNIPERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK ON PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET, IS CURRENTLY UNDER ARREST IN THE SANTIAGO PRISON, AND, TOGETHER WITH VASILY CARILLO NOVA, HE IS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN FOR ONE OF THE FACTIONS OF THIS EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION. DIAZ CARO, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN LATE 1986 BY THE POLICE, ANNOUNCED THAT IN \"A MATTER OF HOURS\" THEY WILL START SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS. HE EXPLAINED THAT THIS NEW PHASE OF ARMED STRUGGLE WILL BE CARRIED OUT \"FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES.\" AT THE SAME TIME HE REFERRED TO THE RESULTS OF THE PLEBISCITE, STATING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY RESPECT THOSE WHO VOTED \"NO,\" \"THE ONLY ASPECT OF THE VICTORY OF THE `NO' WE ACCEPT IS THAT PINOCHET LEAVE POWER.\" IN REFERRING TO THE FPMR'S CHANGE OF STRATEGY, DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE DURING A MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION'S LEADERS LAST APRIL. OF THIS OCCASION THEY DISCUSSED THE LINE THAT THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION SHOULD FOLLOW. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA OF AN \"ARMED REBELLION,\" WHICH PREVAILED UNTIL THEN. THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT IDEA WAS THAT THE ORGANIZATION SERVED TO COMPLEMENT CLASS STRUGGLE (AS IT DID IN ITS ORIGIN IN 1983), TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE'S REBELLION TO PARALYZE THE COUNTRY AND TO PERPETRATE ATTACKS AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED REGIME. DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE THE REBELLION WITH THE SEARCH FOR A PATRIOTIC UNITY GOVERNMENT. HE SAID THAT \"WE REALIZE THAT OUSTING THE REGIME IS SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS UNDER A PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT.\" ACCORDING TO DIAZ CARO THIS IS WHEN THEY REALIZED THE \"NEED FOR A `TRUCE' BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO PLAN GREATER STEPS.\" HE ADDED THAT \"THIS IS WHEN WHAT WE CALL THE `NATIONAL PATRIOTIC WAR' SURFACED. THE MAIN ISSUE OF THIS WAR IS THE ARMED STRUGGLE; WE ARE NO LONGER A MERE COMPLEMENT TO THE PEOPLE. IT REPRESENTS A QUALITATIVE STEP FORWARD AND ENTAILS GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES.\" DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THIS NEW PHASE WILL REQUIRE A GREATER QUANTITY OF WEAPONS, MORE MEN, AND ALL THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO OPERATE. HE SAID THAT THE MONTHS OF TRUCE WERE USED TO FULFILL THESE NEEDS. THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY ALSO DECIDED ON THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A NON-ISOLATED ACTION. \"WE THOUGHT THAT ACTIONS IN SANTIAGO, CONCEPCION, AND VALPARAISO WOULD BE THE SOLUTION, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.\" DIAZ CARO EXPLAINED THAT \"THIS IS WHY WE NOW REALIZE THAT THE STRUGGLE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES, THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY AND IN VARIOUS FORMS.\" (CONTINUED)",

(DUARTE) I UNDERSTAND THAT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAS TO PREPARE A REPORT EVERY YEAR, AND THE ORGANIZATION INCLUDES WHATEVER VIEWS IT CHOOSES IN THE REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION OBVIOUSLY STATES ITS VIEWS IN THE REPORT. SALVADORANS DO THINGS ACCORDING TO THE LAW. IF ANY SALVADORAN OR FOREIGNER HAS EVIDENCE (OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS), THEN IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS. THAT IS THE LOGICAL AND LEGAL WAY FOR US TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION; THAT IS WHAT WE ALWAYS DO IN ALL SUCH CASES. (REPORTER) MR PRESIDENT, YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A SPECIAL REPORT CLAIMING THAT SOME DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS HAVE DESERTED AND IMPLICATED SEVERAL RIGHT-WING MEMBERS IN THE MURDER OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO AND OTHER SALVADORANS. (DUARTE) WE ARE ANALYZING THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN THOSE CASES. YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY ANALYZED THE CASES. I RELEASED INFORMATION ONLY WHEN THE EVIDENCE WAS DULY INVESTIGATED AND CORROBORATED. WE ARE PROCESSING A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, BUT I DO NOT WANT TO DISCUSS IT IN DETAIL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD HINDER THE INVESTIGATION. (REPORTER) IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TWO VIDEO RECORDINGS IN WHICH THE TWO DESERTERS GIVE THEIR NAMES AND DETAILS AND THAT THESE RECORDINGS ARE BEING ANALYZED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND THE GOVERNMENT? (DUARTE) WE ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING THE CASE. THAT IS WHY I SAID THAT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO REVEAL ANY DETAILED INFORMATION--BECAUSE THIS MIGHT HINDER THE INVESTIGATION. (REPORTER) MR PRESIDENT, THE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT STATES THAT DEATH SQUADS--WHICH ARE REPORTEDLY COMPOSED OF SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN--ARE BEING REACTIVATED AT A TIME WHEN THE ARMED FORCES OPPOSE YOUR POLICIES. (DUARTE) I DO NOT THINK SO. MY GOVERNMENT'S POLICY REMAINS UNCHANGED. WE ADVOCATE THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY. I THINK THIS IS ALWAYS EVIDENT. EVERY DAY THIS IS DEMONSTRATED BY EVENTS. (WORDS INDISTINCT) FILM ABOUT GUERRILLA COMMANDERS, WHICH REPRESENTS SUPPORT FOR THE FMLN AND DISTORTS THE PEOPLE'S VIEWS. NEVERTHELESS, WE KNOW THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS MUST PREVAIL AND THEREFORE WE DO NOT INTERVENE. YOU WILL NOT FIND ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT DOES THIS, YET WE ARE DOING SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD DEFEND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ABOVE ALL. (REPORTER) HOW MUCH CREDENCE DO YOU GIVE THE AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT? (DUARTE) THE REPORT IS VALID INSOFAR AS THE FACTS ARE ALL THERE. HOWEVER, I (WORDS INDISTINCT) THE WAY IN WHICH THE FACTS ARE INTERPRETED. THE FACTS ARE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S OWN (WORD INDISTINCT). WE ALSO RECEIVED REPORTS FROM RED CROSS INTERNATIONAL (WORDS INDISTINCT) EACH CASE. EACH CASE IS INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY. THE UNITED NATIONS HAS ITS OWN OPINION; THE OAS HAS ITS OWN OPINION. EACH ONE ISSUES A REPORT, AND WE USE THAT INFORMATION AS THE BASIS FOR OUR INVESTIGATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, WHICH IS THE MAIN ISSUE. (END RECORDING)",

ACCOMPANIED BY FIVE FSLN NATIONAL DIRECTORATE COMMANDERS--HUMBERTO ORTEGA, BAYARDO ARCE, VICTOR TIRADO, CARLOS NUNEZ, AND TOMAS BORGE--AND MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET, ORTEGA ADDRESSED MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ACCREDITED IN NICARAGUA AND THE FOREIGN PRESS TO REQUEST MORE INTERNATIONAL AID FOR THE NICARAGUANS AFFECTED BY HURRICANE JOAN. ORTEGA ALSO ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR ITS MEDIATION IN LIGHT OF A NEW ATTACK BY 3,000 \"CONTRAS\" WHO, ACCORDING TO ORTEGA, ARE AT THE HONDURAN BORDER READY TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK AGAINST HIS PEOPLE \"IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME.\" \"THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST DEMAND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FORGET ITS PLAN TO ATTACK NICARAGUA. THE CONTRAS HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED BY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND ARE READY TO ATTACK AT ANY MOMENT,\" THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ADDED. \"WE KNOW THAT THE REBELS HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO HINDER THE RECONSTRUCTION WORK THAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE HURRICANE. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN ORDERED TO SABOTAGE THE COFFEE HARVEST ACTIVITIES. THE BIGGEST HELP THE YANKEE GOVERNMENT COULD GIVE THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE TO STOP THE ATTACK,\" THE PRESIDENT STRESSED. ORTEGA ANNOUNCED THAT WHILE HIS COUNTRY WAS BEING HIT BY HURRICANE JOAN, THE CONTRAS CARRIED OUT ATTACKS AND KILLED FIVE CIVILIANS. REGARDING THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANE, ORTEGA SAID THAT THIS COMING WEEK, AN ECLA TEAM WILL ARRIVE IN MANAGUA TO MAKE \"FINAL\" EVALUATIONS ON THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY JOAN LAST WEEK. INTERNATIONAL AID \"IS NECESSARY AND URGENT BECAUSE THE SITUATION IS CHAOTIC,\" ORTEGA ADDED, STRESSING THE ROLE PLAYED BY CUBA IN HELPING HIS PEOPLE. HE SAID THAT CUBA SENT 24 PLANES TO NICARAGUA WITH FOOD, MEDICINE, AND MEDICAL TEAMS; MEXICO SENT 2 PLANES; AND SPAIN, GREAT BRITAIN, PANAMA, AND BELGIUM EACH SENT ONE; FOR A TOTAL OF 2,052 TONS OF AID. GIVING A PROVISIONAL REPORT ON THE DAMAGE, ORTEGA SAID THERE WERE 116 DEAD, 178 INJURED, 110 MISSING, AND 29,152 HOUSES DESTROYED AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO AGRICULTURE AND FISHING. HE STRESSED THE DAMAGE TO THE ECOLOGY BECAUSE THOUSANDS OF HECTARES OF FOREST WERE DESTROYED. HE SAID THAT EUROPEAN TECHNICIANS WILL TRAVEL TO NICARAGUA NEXT WEEK TO EVALUATE THE DAMAGE. ORTEGA SAID THAT TO FACE THE HURRICANE, THE COUNTRY USED THE DEFENSE SYSTEM IT WOULD USE TO REPEL A MILITARY ATTACK AND THAT THANKS TO THIS, MANY HUMAN LIVES WERE SAVED.",

COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ANSWERED A URUGUAYAN JOURNALIST'S QUESTION ON THE CURRENT SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY: (BEGIN RECORDING) (REPORTER) THE SITUATION IN YOUR COUNTRY IS VERY SERIOUS. THOUSANDS ARE DEAD, PARAMILITARY DEATH SQUADS GO UNPUNISHED DESPITE THEIR MURDERS OF PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) MEMBERS AND POPULARLY ELECTED LEGISLATORS. MR PRESIDENT, HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS SITUATION AND HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE THE SITUATION EXISTING IN YOUR COUNTRY WITH YOUR AFFIRMATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY? THANK YOU. (BARCO) I DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS RELEVANT TO THE COMPOSITION AND PURPOSE OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING. THE QUESTION ARISES FROM A LACK OF INFORMATION. COLOMBIA IS A DEMOCRACY, SUPPORTED BY A PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES. THE SOLDIERS ARE COLOMBIANS WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. THEY ARE YOUTHS FROM ALL GROUPS, FROM THE RURAL AREAS, THE CITIES, AND FROM ALL POLITICAL PARTIES. THE OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONALS, AND THEY DO NOT FOLLOW MILITARIST DOCTRINES. THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED--MAY I ADD ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL BASIS--IN ANY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION, WILL BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE A MILITARY COURT, AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXPELLED. CIVIL COURTS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF SOME OF THOSE CRIMES, AND SOME ARREST WARRANTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. MILITARY JUSTICE AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO CONDUCTING LEGAL ACTIONS. (END RECORDING) DURING THE SAME NEWS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT BARCO NOTIFIED JOURNALISTS THAT LAST THURSDAY'S STRIKE HAD BEEN AN ATTEMPT BY ARMED REBEL GROUPS AGAINST DEMOCRACY. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESS CENSORSHIP DECREE WAS NO LONGER VALID.",

        "text": "PRESIDENT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE CALLED ON THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL PARTIES THAT WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS TO PROTECT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THE REPUBLIC. DUARTE MADE THIS CALL DURING HIS SPEECH OPENING THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL FAIR OF EL SALVADOR, IN WHICH 25 COUNTRIES ARE PARTICIPATING. (BEGIN RECORDING) (DUARTE) I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PEACE LOVER, AND THAT IS WHY IT GRIEVES ME TO SEE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CURRENT SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND CRISIS. I, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WILL BE STRENGTHENED. I BELIEVE THE MINDS OF MEN WILL BE TRANSFORMED POSITIVELY, AND IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLES--EVEN THE MOST POLARIZED ONES--WILL BE DEFINITELY SOLVED BY THE CIVILIZED MEANS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. I CALL ON ALL POLITICAL PARTIES TO STRENGTHEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL PROCESS AND PUT THE SACRED INTERESTS OF THE NATION BEFORE ANY OTHER INTERESTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT THE REPUBLIC AND CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION THAT BELONGS TO ALL SALVADORANS. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A CALL TO ALL GROUPS SO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, WHICH WILL CULMINATE WITH THE ELECTION OF A NEW PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR, DEVELOPS WITH THE SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR THAT CORRESPONDS TO COURAGEOUS PEOPLE, WHO WISH TO SHOW THE WORLD THEIR POLITICAL MATURITY AND THEIR DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE. THE ELECTORAL PROCESS WILL SLOWLY CONSOLIDATE. I BELIEVE SOONER THAN LATER, GOOD JUDGEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN MAD BY BARBARISM. (END RECORDING) (GOMEZ) PRESIDENT DUARTE ALSO SAID THE FMLN WILL NOT STOP THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THAT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE PRESENTED BY FMLN COMMANDERS JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS AND LEONEL GONZALEZ DURING THEIR LATIN AMERICAN TOUR. (BEGIN RECORDING) (DUARTE) IT IS TRUE THAT THE ENEMIES OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL GO ON CONDUCTING THEIR TERRORIST AND DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. THOSE ACTIONS, HOWEVER, WILL NOT AT ALL AFFECT THE PROGRESS MADE BY OUR DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE. THE TRUTH IS THAT OUR CRISIS IS AS LARGE AS THE EFFORT WE HAVE MADE TO FACE IT. THAT EFFORT GOES BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND REACHES THE ENTIRE WORLD. THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES THAT BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE IN EL SALVADOR ARE (WORD INDISTINCT) AND HAVE BEGAN TO SHOW THEIR RESULTS, DESPITE THE DESPERATE ACTIONS THE FMLN-FDR IS CONDUCTING ABROAD IN ORDER TO COUNTER THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE. THE FOREIGNERS WHO CAME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FAIR AS WELL AS THE DISTINGUISHED OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES WILL CONFIRM THAT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT CIRCULATED ABROAD AND DISSEMINATED AS PART OF AN FMLN -FDR DISINFORMATION PLAN. THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR LOCAL SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS HAVE SAID ABROAD THAT THERE IS REPRESSION IN EL SALVADOR. ONLY A GOVERNMENT THAT IMPOSES ITSELF BY FORCE ON ITS PEOPLE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. OUR COUNTRY NEVER ENJOYED SO MUCH FREEDOM AS NOW AND ITS RULERS WERE NEVER CHOSEN SO FREELY AS THEY ARE NOW. (END RECORDING) (GOMEZ) (WORD INDISTINCT) PRESIDENT DUARTE SAID THE 18TH OAS REGULAR MEETING REPRESENTS THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES' SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.",

        "text": "AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN BERLIN ON FRIDAY (4 NOVEMBER), VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION AND SECRETARIAT OF THE PCCH CENTRAL COMMITTEE, GAVE A REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN CHILE FOLLOWING THE REFERENDUM. HE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE'S RESOLUTE \"NO\" IN THE REFERENDUM ON 5 OCTOBER MUST NOW BE FOLLOWED BY THE OVERTHROW OF PINOCHET AND THE RETURN TO DEMOCRACY. THE FORMER SENATOR SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT CONDITION FOR THE PATH INTO THE FUTURE IS THE CREATION OF A BROAD UNITY OF ALL OPPOSITION FORCES WHICH CAN WIN A VICTORY OVER PINOCHET. HE SAID THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY ALSO CONSIDERS COOPERATION, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE SOCIALISTS, A DECISIVE STEP. HE SAID THAT QUITE A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN CHILE THROUGH THE BROAD MASS MOVEMENT. HIGH OFFICERS WHO SERVED THE DICTATOR MOST LOYALLY HAVE HAD TO RESIGN NOW UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PUBLIC. IN ADDITION, IT HAS JUST BEEN REPORTED THAT EL SIGLO, THE COMMUNIST PARTY NEWSPAPER, WILL BE PUBLISHED AGAIN LEGALLY. ASKED ABOUT THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF THE STRUGGLE, TEITELBOIM SAID THAT THE PROGRESSIVE FORCES IN CHILE, WHO HAD TO PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR THEIR RESISTANCE IN THE PINOCHET'S 15-YEAR RULE, CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO PERSECUTION, IMPRISONMENT, AND THREATS OF MURDER. THE COMMUNIST PARTY, WHICH HAS HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CASUALTIES AND MISSING AND TORTURED PEOPLE SINCE THE DICTATORSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED, CONTINUES TO BE BANNED. NONETHELESS, THE COUNTRY IS CAUGHT UP IN A WAVE OF MOBILIZATION OF THE PEOPLE. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM CONFIRMED THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY SUPPORTS THE DEMAND MADE BY THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE TO HOLD THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS PROMISED BY THE MILITARY JUNTA FOR LATE 1989 AT AN EARLIER DATE, AND TO NOMINATE A COMMON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. IN ADDITION, THE CONSTITUTION--ON THE BASIS OF WHICH PINOCHET INTENDS TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE UNTIL MARCH 1990 DESPITE HIS DEFEAT THROUGH THE REFERENDUM--MUST BE ABOLISHED TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE ON THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE IN FREEDOM. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM PAID TRIBUTE TO THE GDR'S CONSISTENT POSITION IN WORD AND DEED AS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WITH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE. HE SAID THAT HUNDREDS OF PATRIOTS FROM HIS COUNTRY HAVE FOUND A TEMPORARY HOME IN THE GDR, WHERE THEY CAN LIVE AND WORK.",

THE MIR ADDED THAT IT WILL \"TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY SITUATION\" AND THAT IT WILL USE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS BY REGISTERING A LEFTIST PARTY. MIR SPOKESMAN JECAR NEGHME TALKED TO THE PRESS YESTERDAY ABOUT THE RESOLUTIONS APPROVED AT THE LATEST MIR CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 6 AND 7 NOVEMBER. HE SAID THAT IT WAS THE FIRST MEETING HELD IN CHILE SINCE JULY 1973. NEGHME STATED THAT IN ADDITION TO POLITICAL ISSUES, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ALSO PAID HOMAGE TO RAUL PELLEGRIN AND CECILIA MAGNI, MEMBERS OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT WHO WERE KILLED RECENTLY. IN A PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE, THE MIR CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES FOR \"NOT LISTENING TO THE NATIONAL CLAMOR FOR PINOCHET'S RESIGNATION\" AND FOR GIVING PRIORITY TO \"A STRATEGY OF SHADY DEALS AT THE TOP LEVEL.\" THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS: \"ALTHOUGH THE DOCUMENT RELEASED BY THE 16 POLITICAL PARTIES FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE PEOPLE'S DEMANDS, ITS MAIN DEFECT IS THAT BY INCLUDING THE DEMANDS AS PART OF A NEGOTIATING STRATEGY AND BY MAKING THE MOBILIZATION TASKS UNCLEAR, THE DEMANDS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WILL NOT BE HEARD.\" THE MIR ALSO SAID THAT NEXT YEAR IT WILL STRUGGLE FOR THE IMMEDIATE END OF THE REGIME AND THE CONSTITUTION, THE CREATION OF A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE ELECTION OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, THE STRENGTHENING OF THE UNITED LEFT, AND THE PREPARATION OF A \"DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR PROGRAM\" FOR THE COUNTRY. THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THE MIR WILL PROMOTE A TACTIC \"TO DESTABILIZE THE REGIME, TO MAKE THE INSTITUTIONS ILLEGITIMATE, TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY, AND TO ACCUMULATE GREATER FORCE.\" THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE MIR WILL USE \"THE LIMITED POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN ELECTIONS BEGINNING IN 1988.\" THIS IS WHY THE MIR SUPPORTS THE REGISTRATION OF A LEFTIST PARTY: TO PREVENT THE EXCLUSION OF THE LEFT AND \"TO PROMOTE THE GAINS OF THE PEOPLE.\"",

THE REBEL LEADERS MAINTAIN THEY HAVE MET ON FIVE OCCASIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF CONSULTATIONS AND COORDINATION PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA. ACCORDING TO THEM, ONE OF THE MEETINGS INVOLVED MINISTER VALLEJO HIMSELF, WHO REPORTEDLY INTRODUCED THEM TO A DELEGATE OF PRESIDENT BORJA FOR FURTHER TALKS. NEVERTHELESS, VALLEJO DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE COUNTRY. FEBRES-CORDERO'S ADMINISTRATION REFUSED TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT AND FREE HOMELAND MONTONERAS GUERRILLA GROUPS BECAUSE IT CONSIDERED THEM TO BE TERRORIST GROUPS; IT ACTUALLY ATTACKED THESE GROUPS TO THE POINT OF ALMOST ELIMINATING THEM. VALLEJO POINTED OUT THAT HOLDING TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP. HE RECALLED THAT THE COLOMBIAN ADMINISTRATION OF BELISARIO BETANCUR BEGAN A DIALOGUE WITH GENUINE REVOLUTIONARY ARMIES TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THAT COUNTRY. HE ASKED: WHY CAN WE NOT HOLD TALKS HERE, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS ARE STILL AT AN EMBRYONIC PHASE? THE POSSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT-GUERRILLAS TALKS HAS BEEN VIEWED DIFFERENTLY. NATIONAL CONGRESS PRESIDENT WILFRIDO LUCERO SAID ON 25 NOVEMBER THAT THE CONGRESS IS NEITHER TASKED NOR EMPOWERED TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS. LUCERO REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEGED TALKS, SAYING THAT HE HAS RECEIVED NO INFORMATION IN THIS REGARD. HE ADDED: THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF OTHERS; IT IS NOT A CONCERN OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS. ACCORDING TO JULIO CESAR TRUJILLO, A FORMER PRESIDENT OF POPULAR DEMOCRACY, TALKS WITH GUERRILLAS WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE USEFUL IDEAS, SOME OF WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. HE ADDED THAT NOT EVERYTHING ADVOCATED BY THE GUERRILLAS CAN BE CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE ARE OBSTACLES FACING THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE CURRENT RULERS. MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY OF FORMER PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES-CORDERO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THIS POSSIBILITY. IT WILL MEET TOMORROW TO DISCUSS THE TOPIC AND ISSUE AN STATEMENT. MARCO LARA, PRESIDENT OF THAT PARTY AND PUBLIC INFORMATION SECRETARY DURING THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THIS. WHILE IN QUITO (AS HEARD), COMMANDERS JOAQUIN AND JAVIER ARE PROPOSING A BROAD AND DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH RODRIGO BORJA'S REGIME; IN GUAYAQUIL, LEADERS JUAN CUBIA AND EDGAR PRIAS, BOTH IN PRISON, AND PATRICIO BAQUERIZO ARE REJECTING A DEMAND THAT THE MOVEMENT RESPECT THE LAW.",

THE INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY INVOLVE THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES. COLOMBIAN FOREIGN MINISTER JULIO LONDONO PAREDES HAS REQUESTED COORDINATED ACTIONS BY THE TWO COUNTRIES TO PREVENT SUCH BORDER INCIDENTS. IT WAS ADMITTED THAT THE REMAINS OF THE FISHERMEN WERE EXHUMED OVER THE WEEKEND. SEVEN OF THEM WERE EXHUMED ON 26 NOVEMBER AND SIX ON 27 NOVEMBER IN VENEZUELA. THE JUDICIAL REPORT STATED THAT THERE WERE NO GUERRILLA CLASHES AND THAT EACH WAS KILLED BY A COUP DE GRACE OF THE VENEZUELAN ARMY. THE VENEZUELAN INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION ENTRUSTED WITH CLARIFYING THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY AUTHORITIES' REASONS FOR SLAUGHTERING 14 FISHERMEN ON 22 OCTOBER IN EL AMPARO DIRECTLY INVOLVE THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS. THE AUTOPSIES PERFORMED ON NINE BODIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THE PEASANTS OF THE BORDER AREA DID NOT HAVE AN ARMED CLASH WITH THE MILITARY. ON THE CONTRARY, THEY WERE SHOT AT A DISTANCE LESS THAN 1 METER, WHICH IS WHAT THE TWO SURVIVORS SAID FROM THE BEGINNING. THOSE SURVIVORS HAVE NOW REQUESTED ASYLUM IN CARACAS FROM THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. (BEGIN RECORDING) (LONDONO) WE HOPE SUCH INCIDENTS WILL DECREASE AND THAT THE VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES ALONG THE BORDER WILL COORDINATE WITH THE COLOMBIAN CIVILIAN AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES ANY ACTIONS FOR PRESERVING--NOT ONLY THE LIVES OF THE COLOMBIANS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BORDER--PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY IN THE BORDER AREA. (END RECORDING) BECAUSE 2 OF THE 14 MURDERED FISHERMEN WERE COLOMBIANS, LONDONO PAREDES STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL MAINTAIN ITS INITIAL STAND OF DEMANDING COMPENSATION FOR THE RELATIVES OF THE DEAD COLOMBIANS. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO AWAIT AN OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION FROM VENEZUELA ON THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS ON THE EL AMPARO SLAUGHTER.",

THE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS MUST NOT ACCEPT DIALECTIC CONCLUSIONS SUCH AS THE ONES MADE BY THE CRIMINAL JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, WHO SAID WE EXECUTED AND (WORDS INDISTINCT). THEY ARE NOT GOD. THEY TALK AS IF THE WORLD BELONGED TO THEM. THERE ARE LAWS AND A LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN THIS COUNTRY. OUR SYSTEM HAS A LEGAL FRAMEWORK, AND WE HAVE TO BASE OURSELVES ON IT. THERE ARE HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BECOME CORRUPT AND HAVE BECOME ACCOMPLICES OF THE FMLN'S MURDER; THEY REMAIN SILENT AND DO NOT DEFEND JUSTICE, LAWS, AND PRINCIPLES. REGARDING THIS CASE, I ACCUSE THE FMLN OF THESE DEATHS. WE HAVE EVIDENCE THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTS PRESENTLY BEING REPORTED IN THE NORTHWESTERN ZONE.

ACCORDING TO WHAT THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD, A TECHNICAL-COMMUNITY INTEGRATION ORGANIZATION, REPORTED TODAY, THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT WERE ADOPTED BY THE ANDEAN-EUROPEAN JOINT COMMISSION IN THE MEETINGS HELD IN BRUSSELS IN APRIL ARE NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE HOLDING OF THESE TALKS. THE FIRST MEETING IN LIMA WILL BE TO DISCUSS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS THE BETTER USE OF THE GENERALIZED PREFERENTIAL RATES SYSTEM THAT IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE EEC, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE TRADE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS NOT ONLY ENCOMPASS THE STRENGTHENING OF TRADE TIES, BUT ALSO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT. PETER HEISLER, THE CHIEF OF THE EEC DELEGATION, SAID THAT THIS MEETING SHOWS \"OUR WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE.\" ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PROVIDED BY THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD, IN 1986 THE ANDEAN GROUP, COMPRISED OF BOLIVIA, ECUADOR, COLOMBIA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA, RECORDED A DEFICIT OF $266 MILLION IN ITS TRADE WITH EEC COUNTRIES. THIS DEFICIT IN ANDEAN TRADE, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED SINCE 1982, WHEN THE FOREIGN DEBT CRISIS EXPLODED IN ANDEAN GROUP COUNTRIES, IS CAUSED BY THE FALL BY ALMOST 23 PERCENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS, WHICH IN 1988 TOTALED $3.847 BILLION. THIS DEFICIT IS ALSO CAUSED BY AN INCREASE OF 18 PERCENT IN ANDEAN IMPORTS FROM EEC COUNTRIES, WORTH $4.113 BILLION. BETWEEN 1970 AND 1986, THE ANDEAN GROUP ACCUMULATED A TRADE DEFICIT OF $2.175 BILLION WITH THE GROUP OF 12. DURING THIS PERIOD, ANDEAN EXPORTS TOTALED $54.795 BILLION, WHILE IMPORTS TOTALED $56.970 BILLION. THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD MEMBERS AND EEC COUNTRIES WAS SIGNED ON 17 DECEMBER 1983 IN CARTAGENA, COLOMBIA. LATER, THE CONGRESSES OF ALL THE COUNTRIES COMPRISING THE ANDEAN GROUP APPROVED THE AGREEMENT WHILE NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THEM, PARTICULARLY REGARDING TRADE, HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE SINCE APRIL 1988.",

WE HAVE REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE AND ARE WORKING ON A JOINT PLAN TO HELP MINIMIZE TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT THEY WILL TRY TO CARRY OUT AND ARE CARRYING OUT AT THIS VERY MOMENT. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR A DEMONSTRATION THAT IS TO BEGIN AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. THERE WILL BE STUDENTS TOGETHER WITH UNTS (NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS) MEMBERS, WHO ARE GOING TO MARCH THEIR USUAL ROUTE AND END UP AT THE PARK ACROSS FROM THE CATHEDRAL. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AS LONG AS THEY OBEY THE LAW. AS I SAID A FEW DAYS AGO, WE DO NOT WANT CONFRONTATIONS WITH ANYONE. WHAT THEY WANT IS TO CONFRONT POLICE AND PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES FOR THE SAKE OF CREATING A MARTYR, AND WE ARE UNWILLING TO OBLIGE THEM IN THIS ENDEAVOR. (PASSAGE OMITTED) (REPORTER) THE ATTACK AGAINST THE NATIONAL GUARD SEEMS LIKE A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SECURITY CORPS. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE NATIONAL POLICE ARE ON ALERT FOR AN ATTACK IN VIEW OF THE ATTACKS AGAINST THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THE TREASURY POLICE? (GUZMAN) AS I SAID BEFORE, THIS IS NOT NEW FOR US, AND WE ARE MAKING PLANS. YOU NOTICE THAT THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS IS CLOSE TO HOMES. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN USULUTAN AND IN SAN FRANCISCO MORAZAN WHERE THESE PEOPLE ATTACKED WITHOUT CARING WHETHER THEY DESTROYED PRIVATE PROPERTY OR HOMES--EVEN KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS. WE ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS HERE. WE HAVE A STRATEGY. WE EVEN BELIEVE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK FROM INSIDE THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS--IT IS VERY POSSIBLE, THEY HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY BOMBED THE SERVICE STATION HERE, DESTROYING THREE OR FOUR VEHICLES, AND THEY ALSO PLACED BOMBS INSIDE THE GENERAL DIRECTORATE OFFICE. WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN TO TRY TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS. WE ARE READY TO FACE ANY SITUATION. (PASSAGE OMITTED) (REPORTER) WHAT PLANS HAVE YOU MADE FOR THE UPCOMING OAS GENERAL MEETING, AND WHAT SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES WILL THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE IN REGARD TO THIS MEETING? (GUZMAN) YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THESE ARE MAINLY MILITARY PLANS WHICH WE CANNOT VERY WELL DISCLOSE IN ADVANCE. IF I STARTED GIVING OUT THIS INFORMATION, I WOULD BE EXPOSING OUR SECURITY OPERATION FOR THE MEETING. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS SITUATION VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE.

        "text": "DEAR LISTENERS, THE MINISTER HAS ARRIVED AND WE WELCOME HIM AND THANK HIM FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN THIS SEGMENT. GOOD MORNING. (VIDES) GOOD MORNING. (REPORTER) VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED RECENTLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY WORRIED. WHAT ARE THE ARMED FORCES DOING TO GUARANTEE THE PEOPLE'S WELFARE? (VIDES) THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT INCREASED TERRORIST VIOLENCE IS UNDERSTANDABLE. WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT TERRORIST ACTS ALWAYS ESCALATE WHEN IMPORTANT EVENTS ARE EXPECTED. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY; WE RECENTLY SAW IT IN SEOUL, BEFORE THE OLYMPICS, WHEN GROUPS RESORTED TO VIOLENCE TO PROVOKE THE AUTHORITIES AND PREVENT AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT FROM TAKING PLACE. AN OAS MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY IN A FEW DAYS. THE EVENT IS BEING THREATENED BY A NUMBER OF ACTS, PARTICULARLY TERRORIST ACTS IN THE SAN BENITO, MAX DIAZ, ESCALON, AND SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOODS. THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WILL PROTEST AGAINST THE OAS MEETING IF THEY CAUSE TERROR IN THOSE AREAS. WE ARE EXPECTING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM LATIN AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THE UNITED STATES, WHOM THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE WILL CALL OFF THE MEETING BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. THAT IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE INCREASED VIOLENCE. YOU HAVE SEEN THAT WE HAVE INCREASED PATROL OPERATIONS RECENTLY. PATROLS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT AROUND THE VOLCANOES NEAR SAN SALVADOR. SECURITY MEASURES ARE ALSO BEING IMPLEMENTED ON THE PERIPHERY OF SAN SALVADOR AND AROUND THE MEETING VENUE, BUT I CANNOT GIVE YOU THE DETAILS. THERE IS ALSO A COMPLETE SECURITY PLAN FOR THE OFFICIALS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE OAS MEETING. WE ARE READY TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCIDENT TO A MINIMUM. HOWEVER, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND I MUST ADMIT THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE OR A TERRORIST ACT. THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT WILL AFFECT THE SECURITY MEASURES IN THE AREA OF THE MEETING. FOR EXAMPLE, A BLACKOUT CAN BE CAUSED BY CUTTING OFF AN ELECTRIC LINE IN A DISTANT AREA. (REPORTER) GENERAL, THE FMLN'S ATTACKS HAVE NOT BEEN SO OVERWHELMING IN THE PAST, YET NOW THOSE ATTACKS ARE ATTAINING CONSIDERABLE MILITARY SUCCESS. DO THE FMLN'S MILITARY ACTIONS MEAN IT IS SUPERIOR TO THE ARMED FORCES? (VIDES) WE CANNOT CONCEIVE THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE NOTICED THE GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE CURRENTLY VISITING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CONTADORA GROUP MEMBERS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR READING A STATEMENT AT THE OAS MEETING, AND THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO PRESSURE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. THIS PROVES THE REBELS HAVE FAILED MILITARILY, AND THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY. THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO BRING THE WAR TO URBAN AREAS. HOWEVER, THE PLANS OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS--I SHOWED YOU THE DOCUMENTS ON THEIR FIRE PLAN IN ANOTHER MEETING--DID NOT INCLUDE THE TYPE OF TERRORIST ACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN LATELY. INSTEAD, THEY PLANNED A GENERAL UPRISING AND STRIKE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS. THIS PROVES, AS I SAID, THAT THE SUBVERSIVES COULD NOT DEVELOP THEIR FIRE PLAN. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ACTS BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED RESULTS. THIS IS LIKE HAVING A CINEMA SHOW A MOVIE EVERY DAY WITH NO-ONE TURNING UP TO SEE IT. THE SUBVERSIVES ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF EVENT RIGHT NOW TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF MILITARY STRENGTH, SO THE OAS WILL PASS A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING NEGOTIATION TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT. FURTHERMORE, THE REBELS ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND BOYCOTT OUR NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE DEMORALIZED BY TERRORISM AND LACK THE WILL TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS, WHICH MAKES THE ELECTION RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY.

THE BILL, WHICH WAS DISCUSSED IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND THE SENATE, ESTABLISHES PRISON TERMS RANGING FROM 10 TO 20 YEARS. IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FOR PROMULGATION. THE BILL WAS APPROVED 3 MONTHS AFTER PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA PRESENTED IT TO CONGRESS ON 28 JULY, WHEN GARCIA COMPLETED THE 3D YEAR OF A 5-YEAR TERM OF OFFICE WHICH BEGAN IN 1985. THE PROVISIONS APPROVED BY CONGRESS AMEND 6 ARTICLES IN SECTION 8, VOLUME 2 OF THE PERUVIAN PENAL CODE, ADDING MORE SEVERE SENTENCES AND THE MEANS FOR EXPANDING COURT ACTIONS AGAINST SUBVERSION. A PRISON TERM OF 20 YEARS OR MORE WILL BE IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO CAUSE ANXIETY, ALARM, OR TERROR AMONG THE POPULATION OR ANY PART OF IT, ACTS AGAINST A PERSON'S LIFE OR HEALTH, OR ACTS AGAINST PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY IF SUCH ACTS IMPAIR THE COMMUNITY'S BASIC SERVICES. IN ALL CASES, THE INSTIGATORS OR MASTERMINDS, THE PRINCIPALS IN THE SECOND DEGREE, AND THE ACCOMPLICES WILL RECEIVE THE SAME SENTENCES AS THE PERPETRATORS. MORE SEVERE SENTENCES HAVE ALSO BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR CASES IN WHICH A PERPETRATOR BELONGS TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT USES TERRORISM AS A MEANS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, INCLUDING THE MAOIST \"SHINING PATH\" ORGANIZATION AND THE MRTA. SUPPORTING, APPROVING, OR PRAISING TERRORIST ACTS CAN BE PUNISHED WITH PRISON TERMS OF 5 YEARS OR MORE, AND A 5-YEAR PRISON TERM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE CRIME OF MAKING, PURCHASING, STEALING, OR STORING WEAPONS OR EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF TERRORISM. MORE THAN 12,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN PERU IN SUBVERSIVE AND ANTI-SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS SINCE THE \"SHINING PATH\" ORGANIZATION BEGAN ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IN 1980. MORE THAN $10 BILLION IN MATERIAL LOSSES HAVE BEEN REGISTERED AS WELL.",

        "text": "A NEW DIPLOMATIC RIFT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND THE NEIGHBORING REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA FOLLOWING A PROTEST NOTE SENT BY OUR FOREIGN MINISTRY TO THE VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTRY. THE NOTE DENOUNCES THE MASSACRE OF 14 FISHERMEN, INCLUDING TWO COLOMBIANS WHOM THE VENEZUELAN ARMED FORCES ACCUSED OF BEING SUBVERSIVES. THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SCOLDED BY COLOMBIA, SO THE VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SENT A NOTE TO OUR FOREIGN MINISTRY WHICH SAID THAT VENEZUELA REJECTED THE TERMS USED IN THE COLOMBIAN PROTEST NOTE. COLOMBIA HAS SENT 17 FOREIGN MINISTRY NOTES TO VENEZUELA IN THE PAST 2 YEARS, ALL CONCERNING INCIDENTS THAT HAVE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECTED COLOMBIAN CITIZENS. ONLY 2 OF THE 17 PROTEST NOTES HAVE RECEIVED A REPLY, AND THEY NEVER INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REQUESTED BY OUR GOVERNMENT. THE LAST NOTE REPRESENTS A PROTEST FROM OUR GOVERNMENT FOR THE MURDER OF JOSE ANTONIO AREGUA AND JUSTO PASTOR CEBALLOS ON 29 OCTOBER. THEY WERE ASSASSINATED ALONG WITH 12 VENEZUELAN CITIZENS WHEN THE VENEZUELAN ARMY MISTOOK THEM FOR NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY REBELS IN CANO COLORADA, ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, ALONG THE VENEZUELAN BORDER. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES MADE A MISTAKE, THE COUNTRY'S REPLY TO THE NOTE WAS SPITEFUL AND UNSATISFACTORY. THIS REPRESENTS THE WORST DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES SO FAR THIS YEAR. ILDEGAR PEREZ, VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR TO COLOMBIA, PERSONALLY REFERRED TO THE STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES: (BEGIN RECORDING) (PEREZ) LET US SAY THAT RELATIONS AT THIS POINT ARE DELICATE, BUT I WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE THEM AS CRITICAL OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. (END RECORDING) THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT HAS ORDERED THAT THE TWO SURVIVORS OF THE 29 OCTOBER MASSACRE AT THE BORDER BE TRIED. MOREOVER, THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS BEING EXPLOITED IN THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. VERY FEW, HOWEVER, DARE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SITUATION. (VENEZUELAN DEPUTY JUVENCIO PULGAR) (BEGIN RECORDING) WE HAVE DISPUTES AND WE SHOULD NOT COVER THEM UP. COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA HAVE THINGS TO PROTEST ABOUT, BUT ONLY A DIALOGUE WILL LEAD TO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THESE DISPUTES. (END RECORDING)",

        "text": "THE INFLATION `BOGEYMAN' THIS ENTIRE PANORAMA CHANGED WITH THE NO VOTE VICTORY. AND WITH IT CHANGED THE POLICIES AND TOOLS THAT BUCHI'S TEAM WILL HAVE TO RESORT TO UNTIL LATE 1989 AND THAT ARE NOW MUCH MORE DEPENDENT THAN BEFORE ON THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. ONE OPTION IS TO KEEP ON DOING \"MORE OF THE SAME,\" TO IGNORE THE NEW CONTEXT THAT HAS DEVELOPED SINCE 5 OCTOBER, TO DEFUSE THE MONETARY TIME BOMB AND TO APPLY A TIGHT TOURNIQUET TO THE ECONOMY TO PREVENT RENEWED OUTBREAKS OF HIGHER PRICES. THE INFLATION \"BOGEYMAN\" IS BEGINNING TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE FELT (THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, CPI, IS EXPECTED TO BE UP 1.3 TO 1.5 PERCENT THIS MONTH), AND EXPLANATIONS ABOUND. GERARDO ACEITUNO, THE HEAD OF THE FORECASTING WORKSHOP OF THE LABOR ECONOMY PROGRAM, ATTRIBUTES THE MOUNTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES TO THE IMPACT OF THE WAGE HIKE AND HIGHER INTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATES ON DOMESTIC PRICES. HE RECALLS THAT THE PRICES OF FARM PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN \"VIRTUALLY FROZEN FOR A YEAR\" AND THAT THIS EXPLAINS THE HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX, WHICH FELL ONE PERCENT DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS, AND THE CPI, WHICH ROSE 12 PERCENT DURING THE SAME PERIOD. \"THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED, EXCEPT IF BUSINESSMEN WANTED TO SACRIFICE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS, WHICH HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN AFFECTED, BECAUSE THE VAT WAS CUT.\" JUAN VILLARZU, IN CONTRAST, PLACES MOST OF THE BLAME FOR THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON THE EXCESSIVE QUANTITY OF MONEY. ODDLY ENOUGH, HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DEVELOPED AFTER THE VICTORY OF THE NO VOTE IS PRESUMABLY HAVING AN EFFECT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE \"MINI-ADJUSTMENT.\" HE REPORTS THAT SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSMEN ARE POSTPONING THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS, AND THUS THEIR DEMAND FOR CREDIT HAS FALLEN OFF. THE DILEMMA FACING THEM AND OTHER \"ECONOMIC AGENTS\" IS WHETHER TO SPEND THE MONEY OR TO DEPOSIT IT. THE CENTRAL BANK COMES INTO PLAY HERE, BECAUSE \"NOT HAVING TO COMPETE WITH THE BANKS, IT CAN BEGIN SOAKING UP SOME OF THE MONEY IN CIRCULATION WITHOUT BOOSTING INTEREST RATES TOO MUCH. MOREOVER, THEY ARE ALREADY QUITE HIGH: 5 PERCENT FOR 90-DAY OPERATIONS, AS AGAINST 4.2 PERCENT DURING THE FIRST HALF.\" IN ADDITION, IT COULD RESORT TO ITS SIZABLE MONETARY RESERVES AND \"BURN UP\" FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON HIGHER IMPORTS TO ABSORB SOME OF THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY. \"I'M THINKING ABOUT DEVALUATIONS (OF THE PESO) SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE ONES THIS YEAR.\" OPTIONS AFTER THE NO VICTORY IN ANY EVENT, THE LARGE MASS OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION AND THE EXISTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES (WHATEVER THEIR CAUSE) \"CONSTITUTE AN EXPLOSIVE SITUATION,\" WHICH ACCORDING TO VILLARZU THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT IGNORE. BECAUSE \"IF IT HAS ANY POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT LEFT, IT IS THE VICTORY OVER INFLATION.\" AND THE TIGHTENING UP WILL BE EVEN MORE SEVERE IF THE FINANCE MINISTER INSISTS ON ACHIEVING A 5-PERCENT RISE IN THE CPI IN 1989, AS THE DRAFT BUDGET SENT TO THE JUNTA CALLS FOR. EVEN THE CENTRAL BANK REGARDS THIS GOAL AS DANGEROUS. A HIGH-LEVEL CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE SAID THAT \"IT IS VALID TO AIM FOR AN INFLATION RATE LIKE THAT IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH WOULD TRIGGER A HEAVY CONCENTRATION OF SPENDING) REMAINS HIGH.\" ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC CARD ARE THE ALREADY VISIBLE AND STRONG PRESSURES THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEGUN TO APPLY SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE SPENDING IN 1989 OR AT LEAST NOT REDUCE IT. THE RIGHT ALSO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE MORE POPULIST IN NATURE OR THAT HAVE LESS VISIBLE EFFECTS ON VOTERS. SIGNIFICANTLY, EXPERTS ON BUCHI'S OWN TEAM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ADMITTING THAT POLITICAL DEMANDS CAN BE GIVEN TO SOME EXTENT WITHOUT IGNORING CERTAIN PRINCIPLES. GAINING GROUND, AS A RESULT, ARE AN INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE (\"TO PAVE THE WAY FOR HIGHER PAY IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE\") AND FURTHER CUTS IN THE VAT (THE RUMOR OF A CUT TO 12 PERCENT WAS ALREADY MAKING THE ROUNDS BEFORE THE PLEBISCITE) AND IN THE TAX ON CAPITAL. BUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF ENTERPRISES IS STILL STRONGLY SUPPORTED AS WELL. EVERYTHING POINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTION: \"REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND, AT THE SAME TIME, NARROW THE MANEUVERING ROOM ON TAXES FOR A GOVERNMENT DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE.\" IF IT IS SIMILAR, SO MUCH THE BETTER.

JARAMILLO ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN URABA HAVE SHIFTED FROM SUBVERSION TO ABSURD ACTS OF TERRORISM AND VANDALISM THAT CANNOT BE COMPARED TO ACTS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. THE LEFTIST LEADER DESCRIBED THIS TERRORIST ESCALADE AS ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO THE REGION'S ACHIEVING THE SOCIAL PACT THAT IT URGENTLY NEEDS.

MORE SELF-CRITICISM SENATOR ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, ONE OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION CONGRESSMEN, CONTENDED YESTERDAY THAT THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CUT, JORGE CARRILLO, OUGHT TO HELP PROMPT THE LEFT TO MAKE A SERIES OF RECTIFICATIONS. ROJAS SAID: \"JORGE CARRILLO'S LETTER OF RESIGNATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE CUT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT PROPOSALS NOT ONLY FOR THE ORGANIZATION BUT ALSO FOR ALL DEMOCRATIC FORCES. I AM GLAD THAT HIS RESIGNATION WAS NOT ACCEPTED AND I SEE IN THIS DEVELOPMENT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FORCES OF THE LEFT WILL BEGIN A SERIOUS PROCESS OF REFLECTION AND NECESSARY RECTIFICATION SO THAT THEIR STRUGGLES ARE UNDERSTOOD AND TAKEN UP BY THE WORKING CLASS AND THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. \"SOME OF CARRILLO'S PROPOSALS ARE, WITHOUT DOUBT, DEBATABLE, BUT THE INDISCRIMINATE MIX OF ACTIONS IS UNQUESTIONABLY DOING GREAT DAMAGE TO THE COUNTRY AND, MOST OF ALL, TO THE LEFT. A CLEAR LINE MUST BE DRAWN IN WORD AND IN DEED WITH RESPECT TO VIOLENCE. THE FACT THAT SUCH CRUCIAL ASPECTS FOR COLOMBIA'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT WERE DEBATED WITHIN A MAJOR LABOR FEDERATION SHOWS THAT THIS CLASS CAN PLAY A GUIDING ROLE FOR THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. \"THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALONG WITH THE NECESSARY REFORMS, THE UNITY OF THE FEDERATION AND ITS CAPACITY FOR ALLIANCES AND GRASSROOTS MOBILIZATION EMERGE STRENGTHENED.\"",

THE CARDINALS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE PROPOSAL, AND THE M-19 AND FARC HAVE REPLIED. IN FACT, THEY WENT EVEN FURTHER; THEY UNILATERALLY ENDED HOSTILITIES. NOW THE BALL IS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S COURT.

DO YOU THINK WE CAN AGAIN TRUST THESE STATEMENTS? (LEYVA) I CANNOT MEASURE THE CONFIDENCE THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO OTHERS. THE ONLY THING I KNOW IS THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING PEACE, SO I IMAGINE THIS IS PRECISELY THE WAY. THE SUSPICION THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT HAVE OF THEM IS THE SAME AS YOU MIGHT HAVE, BUT IF THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS PEACE, HERE IS WHERE THEY CAN FIND IT, WITH A PRELIMINARY END TO HOSTILITIES ON ALL FRONTS.

A PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL UNIT WAS COMBING THE AREA IN SEARCH OF GUERRILLAS WHEN IT WAS AMBUSHED ON 22 NOVEMBER, THE NEWSPAPER EXPRESO REPORTED TODAY. THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE HAS HIT PERUVIAN TOURIST ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE CITY OF HUARAZ, CAPITAL OF THE ANCASH DEPARTMENT, WHERE FOUR INNS AND HOTELS WERE BOMBED LAST NIGHT, DAMAGING THE BUILDINGS AND INJURING AN 18 YEAR-OLD GIRL. IN CUSCO, 1,000 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, A BUS (AS RECEIVED) HEADING TOWARD MACHU PICHU WENT OUT OF CONTROL AS THE RESULT OF SABOTAGE AND FELL INTO A 60-METER RAVINE. THE WIVES OF THE JERSEY CITY, UNITED STATES, AND CUSCO MAYORS DIED IN THIS ACCIDENT. LEFTIST SENATOR ENRIQUE BERNALES BALLESTEROS, PRESIDENT OF THE SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND STUDY OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE, HAS NOTED THAT THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE HAS CLAIMED THE LIVES OF 21 PEOPLE PER DAY DURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER. HE SAID THAT THE INCREASED VIOLENCE CAN BE TRACED TO ACTIONS BY THE TERRORIST GROUPS SHINING PATH AND TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA). THESE ATTACKS WERE REPRESSED BY THE FORCES OF ORDER. SENATOR BERNALES REPORTED THAT 630 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN VIOLENT ACTS IN NOVEMBER AND THAT 1,775 HAVE BEEN KILLED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS. BERNALES SAID THAT 403 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN NOVEMBER AS A RESULT OF VIOLENT ACTS, INCLUDING 147 CIVILIANS, 165 PRESUMED TERRORISTS, 65 ARMED FORCES MEMBERS, AND 26 DRUG TRAFFICKERS. A TOTAL OF 227 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN URBAN VIOLENT ACTS. SENATOR BERNALES ADDED THAT A TOTAL OF NEARLY 13,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE BEGAN IN 1980. BERNALES EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE FACT THAT 67 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE KILLED IN VIOLENT ACTS INVOLVED YOUTHS WHO WERE BETWEEN 15 AND 29 YEARS OF AGE. HE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES TO COUNTER THIS SOCIAL PHENOMENON. AMID THIS BLOODY AND DESTRUCTIVE SITUATION, THE PERUVIAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE HAS MADE A CHRISTMAS APPEAL, ASKING THAT--WITHOUT IGNORING \"THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION\"--FOR A TRUCE \"FOR PEACE, RECONCILIATION, AND TRANQUILLITY\" TO PREVAIL IN THE COUNTRY. THE BISHOPS SAID: \"RECALLING HE WHO PREVAILED OVER DEATH, WE CALL UPON THOSE WHO HAVE RESORTED TO VIOLENCE AND KILLINGS AS A SOLUTION TO THE EVILS OF SOCIETY, TO ALLOW THE CITIZENS FOR WHOM THEY CLAIM TO STRUGGLE TO LIVE LIKE BROTHERS.\"",

(VILLAGRAN) RIGHT NOW, THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION, ON DIRECTIONS FROM THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND, IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO HUMANIZE THE WAR SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY BY SHOWING RESPECT FOR THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH GUATEMALA SIGNED. WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THE REPRESSIVE WAR THE ARMY HAS BEEN WAGING AGAINST THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE POPULATION HAS REACHED LEVELS OF EXTREME CRUELTY, INCLUDING INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND THE USE OF DEFOLIANTS IN CONFLICT ZONES WHERE CIVILIANS LIVE. THERE IS THE PARTICULAR SITUATION IN WHICH NEITHER THE GUATEMALAN ARMY NOR THE GOVERNMENT TAKE ANY WAR PRISONERS. THIS MAKES US BELIEVE THAT THE CRUELTY USED AGAINST CIVILIANS AND PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE ARMED CONFLICT IS A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. (MARTINEZ) DOES THE URNG HAVE ANY PRISONERS AT THIS MOMENT? (VILLAGRAN) YES. WE HAVE SENT A NOTE TO THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION SO IT CAN HANDLE THE CASE OF SOLDIER CARLOS PEREZ LOPEZ, WHO WAS CAPTURED WOUNDED IN THE SAN MARCOS REGION, NEAR GALVEZ. HE HAS BEEN GIVEN MUCH MEDICAL ATTENTION. NOW THAT HE HAS FULLY RECOVERED, WE ARE THINKING ABOUT PUBLICLY RETURNING THIS GUATEMALAN, AND WE ARE ASKING THE RECONCILIATION COMMISSION TO TAKE MEASURES THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS (IRC) TO RECEIVE THIS MAN IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE HUMANIZATION PROCESS. (MARTINEZ) WILL THIS BE THE FIRST TIME THE URNG WILL MAKE THIS KIND OF CONTACT WITH THE IRC? (VILLAGRAN) THE IRC HAS HAD LOCALIZATION PROBLEMS. THERE HAS BEEN THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS A NATIONAL RED CROSS. CONTACT WITH THE IRC IS POSSIBLE IF THERE IS A PRESENCE OF THIS ORGANIZATION THAT FUNCTIONS BASED ON INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. NOW THAT THE IRC IS PRESENT, THE WORK IS BEING FACILITATED. THE CONTACT WITH THE IRC IS AT THE INITIATION LEVEL. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THESE CONTACTS WILL BE VERY USEFUL IN THE FUTURE, ESPECIALLY FOR PERSONS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ARMED CONFLICT. (MARTINEZ) I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF WE CLOSE THIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU REPEATING THE NAME OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY SOLDIER WHO IS BEING HELD BY THE URNG AND WHOM THE GUERRILLA FORCES ARE PREPARED TO TURN OVER TO THE IRC. (VILLAGRAN) YES. HIS NAME IS CARLOS LOPEZ PEREZ (AS HEARD). (MARTINEZ) THANK YOU, VILLAGRAN.",

        "text": "IT WAS BARELY NOON WHEN A MAN WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON A FLIGHT FROM MEDELLIN WENT INTO THE NATIONAL BOOKSTORE TO BUY SOME NEWSPAPERS. MEANWHILE, HIS BODYGUARD-CHAUFFEUR WAITED FOR HIM IN THE LOBBY. THE MAN WITH THE NEWSPAPERS, A CATTLEMAN NAMED GUSTAVO DE JESUS ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ, HAD JUST LEFT THE BOOKSTORE WHEN THE TROUBLE STARTED. ESCOBAR WAS PREPARING TO GO TO HIS CAR WHEN A MAN APPROACHED HIM. THE MAN, AROUND 35 YEARS OLD AND 5 FEET 9 INCHES TALL, TOOK OUT A 7.65 CALIBER PISTOL AND BEGAN FIRING. PANIC SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE TERMINAL AS PEOPLE THREW THEMSELVES ON THE FLOOR TO AVOID BEING SHOT. ESCOBAR IMMEDIATELY FELL TO THE FLOOR AS HIS ATTACKER TRIED TO ESCAPE THROUGH ONE OF THE EXITS. APPARENTLY, HE DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PRESENCE OF THE BODYGUARD, WHO HAD ENOUGH TIME TO DRAW HIS GUN AND SHOOT THE AGGRESSOR, WHO DIED AT THE SCENE. ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ WAS TAKEN TO THE SAN PEDRO CLAVER CLINIC, WHERE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD ON ARRIVAL. BUT THE TRAGIC EVENT DID NOT END THERE. A 20-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO WAS AT THE AIRPORT, MARIA FLOREZ GUTIERREZ, WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND HER CONDITION WAS LISTED AS SERIOUS WHEN THIS EDITION WENT TO PRINT. EARLY DETAILS DID NOT CLARIFY THE MOTIVATION FOR THE ATTACK. ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS FOUND IN HIS CLOTHING, IN ADDITION TO HIS ACTIVITIES AS A CATTLEMAN, GUSTAVO DE JESUS ESCOBAR WAS A LEGAL ADVISOR IN CONGRESS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS DENIED BY SPOKESMEN FROM THAT INSTITUTION. THINGS TOOK ANOTHER TURN THAT EVENING, WHEN THE TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM 24 HOURS REPORTED THAT ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ WAS THE COUSIN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA. THIS GAVE RISE TO THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE ATTACK WAS LINKED TO THE SERIES OF KILLINGS IN THE SO-CALLED \"CARTEL WAR.\" AS TO THE ATTACKER, NEITHER HIS REAL MOTIVES NOR HIS IDENTITY WERE KNOWN AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

AREVALO IS THE FIRST MAYOR TO RESIGN AS A RESULT OF FMLN THREATS. THE FMLN CLAIMS MAYORS ARE PART OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN CONDUCTED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY. AREVALO, 39, WAS REPORTEDLY THREATENED WITH DEATH BY THE GUERRILLAS, WHO ALSO ORDERED HIM TO LEAVE THE TOWN OF SANTA CLARA, 65 KM EAST OF SAN SALVADOR. AFTER ANNOUNCING HIS RESIGNATION, AREVALO SAID: \"I WANT TO LIVE AND TO FEEL UNTAINTED. I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ENEMIES. I HAVE A WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO NEED ME.\" AREVALO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT HE CANNOT LEAVE SANTA CLARA, A TOWN OF APPROXIMATELY 10,000 PEOPLE, BECAUSE HE CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO. THE FMLN ALSO CLAIMS THAT IN MANY TOWNS IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN EL SALVADOR, AN AREA OVER WHICH IT CLAIMS TO HAVE MORE CONTROL THAN THE ARMY, THERE ARE TWO POWER CENTERS: ONE IS THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT, AND THE OTHER IS THE GOVERNMENT. THE FMLN HAS STATED THAT IT WILL NOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL THAT REGION. THUS FAR THIS YEAR, THE FMLN HAS KILLED EIGHT PDC AND RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE MAYORS IN SANTA ANA, MORAZAN, SAN MIGUEL, AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENTS. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF THESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.",

        "text": "VARYING INTENTIONS THE PROGRAM FOR LEGAL ACTION CERTAINLY RAISES DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AMONG THE PARTNERS IN IU. THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT THAT IN RECENT DAYS. ALL INDICATIONS ARE, INDEED, THAT BECAUSE TIME IS RUNNING SHORT THEY WILL START UP WITHOUT MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION. TO PUT IT MORE CLEARLY, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL THINGS ARE UNDER WAY BEFORE TRYING TO PUT THEIR OWN MARK ON THE NEWBORN. CHRISTIAN LEFT (IC) WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THIS SIGNAL. THE RESOLUTIONS OF ITS PLENUM, MADE PUBLIC ON 28 OCTOBER, CLEARLY REVEALED THAT IT INTENDED TO UNIFY THE ENTIRE LEFT IN THE FORMATION OF THE NEW POLITICAL ENTITY. IN PASSING, THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO THEIR MEN WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE PPD (PARTY FOR DEMOCRACY): THEY HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT NOT BOTH. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MAPU (UNITED POPULAR ACTION MOVEMENT)-BARRUETO IS NOT ADDRESSING WITH THE SAME EARNESTNESS. THEY APPARENTLY SEEK TO TAKE PART IN EVERY GROUP THERE IS, WHETHER IT IS CALLED THE PPD, COSONO (SOCIALIST COMMAND FOR THE NO) OR LEFTIST PARTY. THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PEOPLE WENT EVEN FURTHER. AT NO TIME DID THEY CONCEAL THEIR WISH THAT LUIS MAIRA PRESIDE OVER THE NEW PARTY. THE PLENUM OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY (PS)-ALMEYDA WAS, OF COURSE, THE MOST EAGERLY ANTICIPATED. AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SET THE TONE FOR THE JOCKEYING BY THE LEFT. THEY AMBITIOUSLY FELT THAT THIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE SOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES, SORT OF LIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE: REGISTRATION AND THE SOUGHT-AFTER SOCIALIST UNITY. PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY HELD THEIR PLENUM, WHERE ON 28 AND 29 OCTOBER THEY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTERING THEIR OWN PARTY, IN OTHER WORDS, RESPONDING ONCE AND FOR ALL TO THE INITIATIVES OF THE NUNEZES, WHO TOOK OVER THE PPD, THE ONLY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALIST GROUP. OTHERS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISER TO PROMOTE A PARTY IN THE \"SOCIALIST SPACE,\" BRING TOGETHER THERE CHRISTIAN LEFT, MAPU-BARRUETO AND THE SMALL SOCIALIST GROUPS THAT STILL EXIST, IN OTHER WORDS, COSONO AS A PARTY. THIS STAND OBVIOUSLY GAVE PRIORITY TO SOMETHING OF A LEADING POLITICAL ROLE AND KEPT THE PC AT A DISTANCE. THE OPTION OF REGISTERING A BROAD LEFT-WING GROUP WAS ALSO RAISED AT THE PLENUM; TO MANY THIS ENTAILED A CERTAIN \"SACRIFICE\" OF PREDOMINANCE BY THE SOCIALISTS. THE PS-ALMEYDA ULTIMATELY OPTED FOR A \"CONSENSUS\" VOTE, OF WHOSE PUBLIC VERSION THERE WERE SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS. THERE WAS TALK OF \"THE REGISTRATION OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOCIALIST SPACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GRASSROOTS FORCES AND OF THE PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE SO FAR BELONGED TO UNLEGALIZED PARTIES.\" THE INTENTION OF THE SOCIALIST LANGUAGE WAS CLEAR, BUT THE PARTY DID NOT CLOSE RANKS WITH A BROAD LEFT-WING ALLIANCE. THE EMPHASIS WAS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. WHAT WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC WAS THAT THE POLITICAL VOTE OF \"THE MORE THAN 50 AND FEWER THAN 100 PARTICIPANTS\" SPOKE OF GIVING PRIORITY TO SOCIALIST LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW PARTY. THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOW FOCUSING ON THIS. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THIS YEAR, THE NATION HAS BEEN DISCUSSING PEACE IN A WAY SELDOM HEARD OF BEFORE. ALL COLOMBIANS, INCLUDING ILLUSTRIOUS FORMER PRESIDENTS, THE MEDIA, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, POLITICAL PARTIES, THE REBELS, AND THE NATION AT LARGE, HAVE BEEN VOICING THEIR STRONG DESIRE FOR RECONCILIATION IN THE HOMELAND. WE REBELS HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED PEACE HIGHLY. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE ALWAYS CLEARLY REITERATED THIS IDEA. TO SET THE PROPER FRAME OF MIND, WE WILL RECALL WHAT WAS SAID IN THE LA URIBE AGREEMENT ON 28 MARCH 1984: \"TO ENSURE PEACE IN THE NATION--WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE'S PROSPERITY--AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BASED ON LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, THE FOLLOWING IS HEREBY AGREED UPON. \"1. THE FARC AND EP (POOR PEOPLE'S ARMY) WILL ORDER A CEASE-FIRE AND THE SUSPENSION OF ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ALL FRONTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS OF 0000 ON 28 MAY 1984. \"2. THE FARC AND EP WILL AGAIN CONDEMN AND NOT ALLOW KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION, AND TERRORISM IN ALL THEIR FORMS. FARC-EP WILL HELP ELIMINATE THESE PRACTICES BECAUSE THEY ARE AN ATTACK ON LIBERTY AND HUMAN DIGNITY.\" IN ADDITION, THE M-19 AND EPL (PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY) REACHED THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT: \"... WE BELIEVE THE CESSATION OF ARMED CLASHES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE REBELS IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL REFORMS THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE NEED AND DESIRE. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HIGHEST INTERESTS OF THE HOMELAND, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAVE REACHED THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT: THE NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE COMMISSION, THE EPL GENERAL COMMAND, AND THE M-19 HIGH COMMAND HAVE AGREED ON A CEASE-FIRE. ONCE THIS IS CARRIED OUT, A GREAT NATIONAL DIALOGUE WILL BEGIN, DEVELOP, AND CONCLUDE. THROUGH THIS DIALOGUE, ALL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SECTORS WILL BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SEARCH FOR PEACE BASED ON SOCIAL JUSTICE. \"CONSEQUENTLY, THE EPL GENERAL COMMAND AND THE M-19 HIGH COMMAND HEREBY ORDER ALL FRONTS, COLUMNS, AND UNITS TO CEASE FIRING AND SUSPEND ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS AS OF 1300 ON 30 AUGUST.\" THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF THESE ACCORDS IS NOW WORTH CONSIDERING. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN COLOMBIANS SAID THESE ACCORDS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAD BECOME THE COUNTRY'S NEW POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR USELESS RECRIMINATIONS, BUT FOR A SERIOUS EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHO IS TO BLAME BECAUSE THE ACCORDS WENT PARTIALLY UNFULFILLED. ANYWAY, CONSIDERING THESE ACCORDS WILL NOT HARM THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY. WE HEREBY REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO TALK WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS. THIS WILLINGNESS TO TALK IS SHARED BY ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD AND IS PART OF THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THREE GUERRILLA SUMMIT MEETINGS. WE FULLY AGREE WITH THE PEACE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY SENATOR ALBERTO LEYVA DURAN. WE FIND IT CLEAR, SIMPLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, AND COMPLETE. THIS IS WHY WE WROTE THIS LETTER, MADE OUR LATEST STATEMENTS, AND HAVE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR A UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE AS THE BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR OUR PEOPLE.

        "text": "THE PERUVIAN GOVERNING PARTY, APRA, TODAY ENDED A CONFLICTIVE PARTY CONGRESS ON A NOTE OF DEFEAT FOR PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, AND WITH THE EMERGENCE OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER LUIS ALVA CASTRO AS NEW PARTY LEADER. THE APRA CONGRESS ELIMINATED THE POST OF PARTY PRESIDENT, WHICH WAS CREATED FOR ALAN GARCIA IN 1985, CONSOLIDATING HIS POSITION AS PARTY LEADER FOLLOWING A DECISIVE VICTORY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF THAT YEAR. ACCORDING TO SOME CRITICS WITHIN THE PARTY, THE PERSONALISM THAT HAD CHARACTERIZED GARCIA'S UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP SINCE 1982 WAS THUS ENDED. LUIS ALVA CASTRO, 46, FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND ECONOMY MINISTER AS WELL AS FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, WAS ELECTED BY A LARGE MARGIN AS THE NEW SECRETARY GENERAL, A POST WHICH REGAINED THE HIGHEST STATUS IN THE PARTY. ALVA CASTRO CAPITALIZED ON THE INTERNAL DISSIDENCE AND ON THE PARTY'S DISENCHANTMENT WITH ALAN GARCIA AS A RESULT OF THE DETERIORATION OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE WORST CRISIS IN THIS CENTURY AND IS BLAMED ON THE CHIEF OF STATE'S \"STUBBORNNESS\" IN NOT CHANGING HIS NATIONALISTIC AND POPULIST POLICY LINE.\" THE NEW CADRE ELECTED AT THE 16TH APRA CONGRESS IS IN FAVOR OF A \"CHANGE IN ORIENTATION\" IN THE PARTY'S MANAGEMENT AND IN THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION FOR THE REMAINING 18 MONTHS OF THE APRA'S TERM IN OFFICE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT ALAN GARCIA AND ALVA CASTRO MAY REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE RUN UNTIL 1990, WHEN THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL TERM WILL END FOLLOWING NEW GENERAL ELECTIONS. GARCIA ALSO LOST THE PRESIDENCY OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION THAT SETS THE PARTY'S POLITICAL LINE. THIS POST WAS WON BY LUIS ALBERTO SANCHEZ, 88, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATION AND ONE OF THE MAINSPRINGS IN THE CHANGEOVER OPERATION WITHIN THE APRA. THE OTHER ELECTIVE POSITIONS WERE FILLED WITH APRA MEMBERS WHO DO NOT FOLLOW GARCIA'S LINE. THUS, THE PRESENCE OF ALAN GARCIA WITHIN THE PARTY WAS REDUCED TO BEING MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION IN HIS CAPACITY AS FORMER PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL. TWO DAYS AGO, THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE RESIGNED THE APRA PRESIDENCY, UPSET OVER CRITICISM DIRECTED AT HIM DURING THE OPENING OF THE PARTY CONGRESS. HE THUS RESPONDED TO OBVIOUS SIGNS THAT THE PARTY PRESIDENT POST WOULD BE ELIMINATED. THE APRA HAD THOUGHT ALAN GARCIA WOULD BE A VERY CAPABLE HEIR TO VICTOR RAUL HAYA DE LA TORRE, THE PARTY'S FOUNDER AND HISTORICAL LEADER, WHO DIED IN 1979. THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS AFTER GARCIA'S ELECTION VICTORY, THE PARTY DISQUALIFIED GARCIA FOR THE ROLE OF HAYA DE LA TORRE'S SUCCESSOR BECAUSE OF HIS ERRORS AND HIS FAILURE TO RECTIFY HIS GOVERNMENT LINE. FOLLOWING THE TRADITION INITIATED BY ALAN GARCIA, NEW APRA LEADER LUIS ALVA CASTRO WILL BE SWORN IN AS SECRETARY GENERAL THIS COMING FRIDAY BEFORE THE TOMB OF HAYA DE LA TORRE IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF TRUJILLO, THE APRA'S MAIN BASTION. THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, MARKED BY 2,000-PERCENT INFLATION AND A 20-PERCENT RECESSION FROM OCTOBER 1987 TO OCTOBER 1988, IS COMPOUNDED BY SOCIAL INSTABILITY AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE, WITH KILLINGS AVERAGING FOUR PER DAY. AN INTERNAL POLITICAL STORM HIT THE APRA 16TH NATIONAL CONGRESS, AND VICE PRESIDENT SANCHEZ SAID THAT HE CANNOT RECALL ANYTHING SIMILAR. DURING THE LAST SESSION OF THE CONGRESS, THREE YOUTHS WERE INJURED IN A MELEE AMONG APRA PEOPLE. OTHER PARTY MEMBERS WERE HIT ON THE HEAD WITH HANDGUN BUTTS, AND THREE NEWSMEN--WHO HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO ATTEND THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONGRESS--WERE ATTACKED.",

AT 2130 IN THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD OF PLATINEDI, A CAR PASSING 2 BLOCKS FROM THE PUBLIC SECURITY SECRETARY OF THE STATE WAS SURROUNDED BY A GROUP OF FEDERAL POLICEMEN ARMED WITH PISTOLS AND MACHINEGUNS. IN A QUICK OPERATION, A MAN AND A WOMAN WERE ARRESTED AND THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE DISTRICT POLICE OFFICE. ONLY TODAY WERE THE CONTENTS OF THE CAR EXHIBITED: SEVEN SUITCASES WITH 51 PLASTIC BAGS CONTAINING A TOTAL OF 160 KILOGRAMS OF COCAINE. THIS AMOUNT OF COCAINE IS WORTH NEARLY $2 MILLION. TO DISGUISE THE ODOR OF THE DRUG THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS PACKED SOME PINEAPPLES AMONG THE PLASTIC BAGS. THE FEDERAL POLICE DID NOT REVEAL THE DETAILS OF THE OPERATION, NOR DID THEY IDENTIFY THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. IT WAS LEARNED THAT THEY ARE LEOPOLDO GOMES PORTAO AND GENILDE FERNANDES MORAIS, WHO LIVE IN CORUMBA, MATO GROSSO DO SUL. THEY PICKED UP THE COCAINE IN BOLIVIA, AND THEY WERE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE IT IN SAO PAULO AND RIO DE JANEIRO. THE FEDERAL POLICE REVEALED THAT LEOPOLDO GOMES PORTAO HAD ALREADY SERVED PRISON TIME TWICE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THAT THE CAR HE WAS DRIVING HAD BEEN STOLEN IN RIO DE JANEIRO.",

IN CARACAS WE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO NEGOTIATING AND HOLDING TALKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CEASE-FIRE AND THE NECESSARY AGREEMENTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE NATION. THAT IS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITHOUT THAT GOAL, WITHOUT HAVING ANY COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE ANYTHING. HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SITUATION SHOULD REMAIN THE SAME. NOW THERE IS A NEW FACTOR, A COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE AND REACH AGREEMENTS ON ALL THOSE TOPICS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THE AGENDA, THAT THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED, AND THAT THEY KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TIMETABLE AGREEMENT FOR DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS. YOU JOURNALISTS CAN HELP THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PROBLEM. (REPORTER) (WORDS INDISTINCT) COMMANDER, WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE FMLN TO JOIN THE PROCESS? (HANDAL) LOOK, DEADLINES ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS TO REACH POLITICAL AGREEMENTS. THAT IS THE MAIN ASPECT OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME DEADLINES WILL NOT BE MET. IF DEADLINES ARE SET AND THE TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM EXPIRES, THEN THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO WASTING TIME. THIS THEN LEADS TO STEPS BEING DEMANDED THAT IN REALITY DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT ARE REACHED AND NOT THE DEADLINES FOR REACHING THEM. THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE AGENDA AND THE TIMETABLE AGREED TO HERE IN CARACAS, THE ACCENT IS ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS. THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGES WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES. EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE CHANGED. EVERY FACTOR CONCERNING THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE REVIEWED FROM A CERTAIN POINT OR PERSPECTIVE. CHANGES ARE NECESSARY; CHANGES MUST BE MADE AND THOSE CHANGES MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. THESE CHANGES MUST COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE ARMED FORCES, BEGINNING WITH ITS ROLE AND INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING THE COUNTRY'S POLICIES AND GUIDELINES. WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTING PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD FOR SOME TIME. THE TOPIC OF DEMOCRATIZATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE TOPIC OF THE ARMED FORCES, TO ITS PURGING, ITS REDUCTION, AND IN SUM, ITS END. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT ALWAYS NEED THE ARMED FORCES. AS WITH ANY INSTITUTION OR HISTORICAL FACTOR, IT EMERGES, IT IS MAINTAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT TENDS TO DISAPPEAR. THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. IT CANNOT CONTINUE ALONG THE SAME PATH BECAUSE THIS WOULD ONLY REPRESENT EXPENSES AND A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE COUNTRY. FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE MEANT ABSENCE OF LIBERTY, REAL SECURITY, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S PATH. ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A MERE FORMALITY, WHERE THOSE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED RUN THE COUNTRY. THE COUNTRY IS NOW GOING THROUGH A DRAMA THAT HAS ALSO SHOCKED THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. EVERYONE IS AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPING THAT THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME WILL BE PUNISHED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASE OF JESUIT PRIESTS IS REALLY GRAVE; IT IS A DRAMA THAT REFLECTS THE DRAMA OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HISTORY IN THE CURRENT CENTURY. (CONTINUED)",

THE TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT SOME MILITARY WERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT DAYBREAK ON 16 NOVEMBER, AS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON 7 JANUARY. \"THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN REST ASSURED THE SALVADORAN JUDICIARY SYSTEM WILL NOT HESITATE TO ENFORCE THE LAW UPON THE AUTHORS OF THIS HORRIBLE CRIME,\" DR GUTIERREZ POINTED OUT. GUTIERREZ SAID HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED OR THEIR MILITARY RANKS, BECAUSE THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS STILL CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND HAS NOT PRESENTED ITS REPORT TO THE TRIBUNAL. HOWEVER, GENERAL PROSECUTOR DR MAURICIO EDUARDO COLORADO MAINTAINED THAT THE MILITARY SUSPECTS \"ARE REGROUPED AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN CUSTODY.\" HOWEVER, HE DID NOT REVEAL THE NAMES OR THE MILITARY RANKS OF THE SUSPECTS. THE PROSECUTOR SAID THAT THE SCIENTIFIC TEST CONDUCTED BY THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND THE SPECIALIZED POLICE WORKING ON THIS CASE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE CRIME COULD HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY ARMED FORCES MEMBERS. \"THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE WILL PROCEED ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND AGAINST WHOEVER TURNS OUT TO BE GUILTY, BECAUSE IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,\" COLORADO SAID. ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, JUSTICE MINISTER DR OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS SAID: \"WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION ON THIS CASE WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC A FEW DAYS AGO.\" HE REFUSED TO MAKE ANY FURTHER STATEMENTS. NEW UCA (CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY) RECTOR JESUIT FRANCISCO ESTRADA ADMITTED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS TAKEN \"A STEP FORWARD\" BY UNMASKING THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CRIME, \"BECAUSE HIS ETHIC PRINCIPLES DO NOT TOLERATE SUCH ATROCITIES.\" ESTRADA SAID HE UNDERSTANDS WHY CRISTIANI, DURING HIS 7 JANUARY SPEECH, DID NOT GIVE ANY NAMES, \"BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL BEING CONDUCTED.\" MOREOVER, THERE MUST NOT ONLY BE ONE SUSPECT, BUT RATHER SEVERAL.\" BEFORE MEETING WITH THE REPORTERS, THE UCA RECTOR MET WITH OFFICIALS FROM SCOTLAND YARD. A FEW DAYS AGO, HE ALSO MET SPANISH, CANADIAN, AND U.S. POLICEMEN WHO, AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST, ARE ASSISTING THE SALVADORAN COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF CLARIFYING THIS CASE.",

HE WAS DRIVING WITHOUT AN ESCORT. ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES, THE CAR IN WHICH THE CRIMINALS FLED WAS ABANDONED IN SURQUILLO DISTRICT. THE DIRCOTE (COUNTERTERRORISM DIVISON) HAS IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE TERRORISTS AS GERARDO OLIVOS SILVA THROUGH A COMPOSITE MADE FROM WITNESS' REPORTS. THE POLICE SAY THAT OLIVOS SILVA, A FORESTRY ENGINEER, HAS PARTICIPATED IN OTHER ATTACKS AGAINST ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL IN THE PAST. LOPEZ ALBUJAR'S MURDER HAS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION IN PERU.

ACCORDING TO A DIJIN REPORT, THE POLICE INFILTRATED THE INNER STRUCTURE OF THE CAMILO ZAPATA VASQUEZ FAMILY. THE NOTICIERO DE LAS SIETE NEWSCAST MANAGED TO SHOOT VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THE RAID ON THE LA MARIA FARM ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGOTA. HERE IS EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE AND A REPORT BY WILLIAM CALDERON: (BEGIN RECORDING) (CALDERON) ANONYMOUS CALLERS INFORMED THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT LA MARIA FARM, A LUXURIOUS RANCH LOCATED NEAR ASUBA, A FEW KILOMETERS FROM BOGOTA. AT 1900, A GOES (SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP) TEAM SURROUNDED THE RANCH. AN AGENT MAKES SURE THE MAIN GATE IS NOT ELECTRICALLY WIRED, AND THE DECISION TO FORCIBLY ENTER THE HOUSE IS MADE. THEY ALL COVER ONE ANOTHER AS THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS. THESE MEN ARE PERFECTLY TRAINED FOR THIS SORT OF WORK. THESE IS A LIGHT INSIDE THE RANCH HOUSE, SO THEY ASSUME SOMEONE IS INSIDE. TENSION RISES IN VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION. AS HE APPROACHES THE RANCH, THE COMMANDER DECIDES TO STORM IT. MOMENTS LATER, SEVERAL MEN OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT OFFERING RESISTANCE AND SURRENDER TO THE AUTHORITIES. A PATROL ENTERS QUICKLY AND CONTROLS EVERY CORNER OF THE RANCH. OTHER UNIFORMED MEN SUPPORT THE OPERATION FROM OUTSIDE. THEY UNSUCCESSFULLY LOOK FOR CACHES. THESE THREE WORKERS WHO WERE DOING REPAIRS AT THE RANCH WERE DETAINED AS A PRECAUTION IN THE MAIN HALL. MEANWHILE, THE SEARCH CONTINUES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE HOUSE. THREE SAFES WERE HIDDEN IN DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE. ONE OF THE SAFES WAS BUILT INTO ONE OF THE EIGHT MARBLE-TILED BATHROOMS. THE HUGE KITCHEN WAS TEMPORARILY AT THE WORKERS' DISPOSAL. NEAR THE MASTER BEDROOM WAS A LARGE SWIMMING POOL WITH A GROUND-LEVEL WINDOW FROM THE SAUNA AND JACUZZI AREA. THERE WERE SEVERAL GAME ROOMS AND TENNIS AND SQUASH COURTS IN THE HOUSE. THE AUTHORITIES NOW HAVE DOCUMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS, ALTHOUGH THE RESIDENTS OF THIS LUXURY RANCH HAD LEFT BEFORE THE RAID. NINETEEN OTHER OPERATIONS WERE SIMULTANEOULSY CONDUCTED IN BOGOTA. THE AUTHORITIES SAID AFTERWARD THAT THEY FELT THEY HAD DISMANTLED THE BOGOTA CARTEL. THE DIJIN RELEASED THE FOLLOWING REPORT: 10 PERSONS ARRESTED, INCLUDING JESUS EVELIO ZAPATA LOPEZ, THE ALLEGED HEAD OF THIS DRUG TRAFFICKING BAND THAT HAD INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS. THE FOLLOWING WAS SEIZED: 3 CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT WORTH ALMOST 250 MILLION PESOS; 1 1977 PORSCHE SIMILAR TO THE ONE SEIZED FROM JORGE LUIS OCHOA IN 1988; 3 TOYOTAS, ONE OF WHICH WAS SOLD 4 MONTHS AGO BY AN ECUADORAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN BOGOTA; 3 REVOLVERS; 3 PISTOLS; 1 CARBINE; AMMUNITION; RADIO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT; 2 FALSE DIPLOMATIC LICENCE PLATES; AND CASH.

ORDONEZ REYES ACCUSED JOSE JESUS PENA--ALLEGED CHIEF OF SECURITY FOR THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA--OF MASTERMINDING THE 7 JANUARY ASSASSINATION OF CONTRA COMMANDER MANUEL ANTONIO RUGAMA. (BEGIN RECORDING) (MEMBRENO) WE CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT ALLEGATION. THESE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE EMBASSY ARE RIDICULOUS. THE EMBASSY HAS NO OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE WITH THE NAME OF THE MAN IDENTIFIED IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MANY ACCOUNTS OF THIS INCIDENT THAT POINT TO THE COUNTERREVOLUTION. WE CATEGORICALLY DENY THESE ACCUSATIONS AND CHARACTERIZE THEM AS RIDICULOUS. WE HAVE NO SECURITY OFFICERS AT THIS EMBASSY, ONLY DIPLOMATIC AND SUPPORT PERSONNEL. (END RECORDING) (ALVAREZ) ALL THE PERSONNEL WHO WORK AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA ARE APPOINTED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, ACCORDING TO THE COUNSELOR. (BEGIN RECORDING) (MEMBRENO) ALL OUR PERSONNEL ARE NICARAGUANS. IN REGARD TO WHAT HE (ORDONEZ REYES) HAS INVENTED, WE THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS. WE ONLY HAVE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL WORKING AT THE EMBASSY. (END RECORDING) (ALVAREZ) REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY AGENTS INFILTRATED THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA, COUNSELOR JUAN JOSE MEMBRENO REPLIED: (BEGIN RECORDING) (MEMBRENO) THIS HAPPENED AT THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE. THE AMBASSADOR LEARNED BY CHANCE THAT ONE OF THE RESIDENCE GUARDS WAS OF NICARAGUAN ORIGIN WITH ALLEDGED COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY LINKS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. THIS CASE DID NOT OCCUR AT THE EMBASSY. (ALVAREZ) IS MANAGUA INTERESTED IN ELIMINATING ALL THE CONTRA LEADERS LIVING IN HONDURAS OR ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE LINKED TO THE COUNTERREVOLUTION? (MEMBRENO) ON THE CONTRARY, WE RESPECT PEOPLES' LIVES AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO RECEIVE IN NICARAGUA ALL NICARAGUANS WHO WANT TO ACCEPT AMNESTY AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE IN ONE WAY OR OTHER BEEN INVOLVED IN THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY CAMPAIGN. (ALVAREZ) HAVE THERE BEEN ANY MORE ATTACKS AGAINST THIS EMBASSY OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF THREAT, AS OCCURRED A FEW DAYS AGO? (MEMBRENO) NO, AFTER THE SHOOTING INCIDENT AT THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, WHAT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS LATER--HERE AT THE EMBASSY--WAS THAT A CAR DROVE PAST THE EMBASSY AT NIGHT AND KNOCKED DOWN SOME SECURITY RAILS ON THE SIDEWALK.

THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY MET THIS MORNING WITH PRESIDENT DUARTE, AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES; DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL CARLOS EUGENIO VIDES CASANOVA; AND ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE. THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND TRUSTS THE POLITICAL PARTIES' MATURITY AND WILL SUPPORT ANY RESOLUTION THEY APPROVE CONCERNING THE FMLN PROPOSAL, THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID FOLLOWING A PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD AND POLITICAL COMMISSION. (BEGIN RECORDING) (GEN VIDES) I TOLD THE POLITICAL PARTIES: IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM ADVANTAGES SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR CANDIDATES TO WIN, GO AHEAD AND DO IT. THEY MUST DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE ADVANTAGES OR NOT; BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE UNJUST. A DEATH SQUAD MIGHT SAY: WE DO NOT WANT PEACE AND WE WILL SET OFF BOMBS UNTIL THE OTHERS CHANGE THEIR MINDS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW. WE WOULD BE SIMPLY ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT. THAT IS THE MAIN DANGER. IF THE CONSTITUTION IS CHANGED AT WILL TODAY THEN IT CAN BE CHANGED AGAIN TOMORROW, AND AGAIN UNTIL THINGS ARE JUST AS THE REBELS WANT THEM. (END RECORDING) THE MEETING WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY NAPOLEON DUARTE, IN HIS ROLE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. (BEGIN RECORDING) (DUARTE) I AM HERE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. I FULLY SUPPORT THE ARMED FORCES' DECISION CONCERNING ITS UNITY AND THE NEED TO (WORDS INDISTINCT) CONSTITUTION, AND THE WARNING THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL NOT ADOPT POSITIONS TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN TOO MUCH BLOODSHED AND TOO MANY LIVES LOST ALREADY. (END RECORDING) IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE FMLN PROPOSAL WAS THOROUGHLY ANALYZED DURING THE MEETING, AND IT WAS AGREED THAT THE CONSTITUTION CANNOT BE VIOLATED TO FAVOR MINORITY GROUPS' POSITIONS. THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADDED: THE ARMED FORCES ARE STRONGER THAN EVER. HE ALSO REFERRED TO THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND SAID THAT HIS VIEWS COINCIDE WITH THE ARMED FORCES' GOALS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND'S VISIT TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS CONSIDERED THE SECOND STEP TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. THE FIRST STEP WAS TO CALL A MEETING OF THE THE POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH WAS NOT ATTENDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT SERVED AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE MEETINGS IN A SO-CALLED NEUTRAL PLACE. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S POLITICAL COMMISSION HAS NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF INVITING ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS, WHO IS INVOLVED TO SOME DEGREE IN THE REBEL PROPOSAL.",

        "text": "THE FMLN REPORTS TO OUR PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION (FENASTRAS) WAS PLANNED IN COLD BLOOD. THE SITE AND THE MOMENT WHEN THE FENASTRAS LEADERS WERE MEETING HAD BEEN SELECTED. 2. WE HAVE TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION FROM OUR INTELLIGENCE ORGANS THAT THIS ACTION WAS ORDERED BY COLONEL PONCE, THAT CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT AND APPROVED IT, AND THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTE AS THE HEAD OF THE MORBID DEATH SQUAD OF THE ARMY'S 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN RESPONSE TO OUR MILITARY ATTACK ON THE ARMY STAFF. THIS BEHAVIOR BY CRISTIANI SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE. TERRORISM IS AN OLD PRACTICE OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA). ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, ARENA ASSASSINS TRIED TO KILL THE PRESIDENT OF THE MORTGAGE BANK, MR MASON, FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEIR ORDERS. 3. THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE RESIGNATION OF CHIEF OF STAFF COL EMILIO PONCE BECAUSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS CRIMINAL ACTION IS REAL. 4. THE FMLN HAS PRUDENTLY TAKEN TIME BEFORE ADOPTING A DEFINITE POSITION. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADOPTED AN IRRESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE AND HAVE BRAZENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT. IN VIEW OF THIS ATTITUDE AND OF THE PEOPLE'S INDIGNATION, WE HAVE TO PREVENT OUR PRESENCE AT THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MASSACRE AND TO ENHANCE THE MASK OF MODERATOR AND NEGOTIATOR THAT CRISTIANI HAS BEEN USING TO SECURE POLITICAL SUPPORT AND U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE WAR. IN SAN JOSE, SPEAKING ON ITS VIEW OF THE WAR, THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS AS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FMLN, AND THEREFORE, AS ENEMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ARMED CONFLICT. WE DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GIVE US A LIST OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, BUT TO NO AVAIL. THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND MASSACRES ARE NOW YIELDING THE LISTS THAT WERE DENIED TO US AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE. EVEN BEFORE THE SAN JOSE MEETING, THE GOVERNMENT HAD GREATLY INCREASED ITS REPRESSION. SINCE THE MEETING, IT HAS INCREASED ITS DETENTIONS AND ATTACKED THE RESIDENCES OF LEADERS OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND THE UDN (NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION), UNIVERSITY, FECMASAN (MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES), AND FENASTRAS. MEANWHILE, CRISTIANI IS MAINTAINING HIS HYPOCRITICAL POSITION OF MODERATION. THE MASSACRES, DETENTIONS, AND REPRESSION OF EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS, THE REPATRIATED, UNIVERSITIES, LABOR UNIONS, PEASANT COOPERATIVES, MOTHERS' ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION SHOW THAT THE WAR OF THE ARMED FORCES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARENA IS AIMED AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND, THEREFORE, THESE GROUPS CANNOT AND WILL NOT REMAIN IDLE. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP ARMS AND EXERCISE THEIR LEGITIMATE DEFENSE. THE ARMED PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE HEADED BY THE FMLN IS JUST, LEGITIMATE, AND NECESSARY. (WORDS INDISTINCT) TWO-FACED CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE DIALOGUE OBSERVERS AND THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE MEDIATOR, TO DEMAND THROUGH THEM GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION CIVIC AND LABOR GROUPS AND A REVIEW OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF THE DIALOGUE, NEGOTIATION PROCESS, AND ITS PROSPECTS. MEANWHILE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CARACAS MEETING. (SIGNED) FMLN GENERAL COMMAND: COMMANDERS SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN, FRANCISCO JOVEL, SHAFIK JORGE HANDAL, EDUARDO SANCHO, AND JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS EL SALVADOR, 2 NOVEMBER 1989",

AT 0530 THIS MORNING, UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PLACED THREE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF MERINO'S HOME IN THE MACHILIGUAS NEIGHBORHOOD. TWO OF THE DEVICES EXPLODED. REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE PERPETRATORS, WHO ARRIVED IN A VEHICLE, ALSO FIRED AT THE GUARDS PROTECTING MERINO'S RESIDENCE. EARLY REPORTS POINTED TO URBAN COMMANDOS AS THE PRESUMED PERPETRATORS, BUT A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MODESTO RAMIREZ CENTRAL FRONT, IN A TELEPHONE CALL, DENIED THE REPORT. (BEGIN RECORDING) (UNIDENTIFIED FMLN SPOKESMAN) ON THIS OCCASION, THE FMLN MUST EXPLAIN THAT OUR FORCES DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ATTACK IN QUESTION. THE FMLN WARNS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION TO CREATE CONFUSION AND PROMOTE TRUE STATE TERRORISM. THE FMLN CONDEMNS THE (WORD INDISTINCT) AGAINST OUR PEOPLE AND WARNS THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. THE FMLN CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTIONS IN WHICH IT IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED. IN THIS CASE, WE WERE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED. THE FMLN WARNS THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS SITUATION TO PERPETRATE ATTACKS ON INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH CAN BE EASILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE FMLN. (END RECORDING) THE FMLN DESCRIBED STATEMENTS MADE BY PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AS IRRESPONSIBLE. THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IMMEDIATELY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE URBAN COMMANDOS. AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS WOUNDED AND CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE WAS REPORTED.

THE ATTACK CAME MAINLY FROM THE SOUTH, WHERE THE COHACHE ORGANIZATION IS LOCATED, AND FROM THE HONDUA CHURCH HERE. THEY ALSO ATTACKED FROM THE NORTHEAST, BUT MOST OF THE ATTACKERS CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, FIRING FROM THERE AT SOME (WORD INDISTINCT) WE HAVE IN THE AREA. WE HAD REMOVED THE CORDON AROUND THE UNIVERSITY 4 OR 5 DAYS AGO, AND (WORDS INDISTINCT) FIRED FROM THERE. THE WOUNDED INCLUDE AT LEAST THREE CIVILIANS, ONE OF WHOM IS IN SERIOUS CONDITION AND HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN BY OUR TROOPS TO THE MILITARY HOSPITAL; PERHAPS FIVE TRAFFIC POLICEMEN, ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED; AND A SOLDIER OF THE BELLOSO BATTALION. NO DAMAGE WAS CAUSED HERE AT THE GARRISON. ONLY A FEW SHELLS HIT THE GARRISON, AND THESE WERE 60-MM MORTAR SHELLS, WHICH ARE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CAUSE DAMAGE. WE FOUND SIX (WORDS INDISTINCT). AS FOR THE RPG'S, WE FOUND ONLY ONE (WORDS INDISTINCT) BEHIND THE ANTEL (NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS) OFFICE (WORDS INDISTINCT). WE FOUND SIX HOLES FROM M-79 SHELLS, BUT THEY DID NOT CAUSE GREAT DAMAGE. ONE OF OUR CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES CAME OUT SLIGHTLY WOUNDED FROM THE (WORD INDISTINCT). (REPORTER) COLONEL, OUR COUNTRY WILL HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT IN A FEW DAYS. THE FMLN HAS CALLED A NEW TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE BEGINNING ON 31 MAY AND HAS NOW ATTACKED THE 1ST BRIGADE. BASED ON THIS EVIDENCE, DO YOU FEEL THE FMLN WILL INTENSIFY ITS MILITARY ACTIONS IN SAN SALVADOR? (MILITARY OFFICER) OF COURSE, WE ARE EXPECTING THIS. CHANNEL 12 HAS ALREADY REPORTED THAT A TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE WILL BEGIN ON 31 MAY. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE VIGILANCE MUST BE INCREASED. WE EXPECTED THIS KIND OF ATTACK. WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID WE ARE PREPARED TO REPEL ANY TERRORIST ATTACK, AND THIS WAS A TYPICAL TERRORIST ATTACK. FROM A MILITARY STANDPOINT, I DO NOT THINK THE ATTACK WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. THE GUERRILLAS USED MORTARS BUT MOSTLY HURT CIVILIANS. (END RECORDING)",

COLONEL ARMANDO SANTAGORDA, IN A STATEMENT TO PANAMERICANA, SAID THAT HIS GROUP IS SUPPORTED BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE, WHO HAS GIVEN PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL POLICEMEN TO COOPERATE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS. MOREOVER, HE SAID THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ARRIVAL IN THE PAST FEW HOURS OF SPECIALIZED U.S. POLICEMEN, ALLEGEDLY HERE TO COOPERATE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT, SO FAR, ARE UNDER THE COMMAND AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOLIVIAN POLICE FORCES. HOWEVER, SANTAGORDA ASSERTED THAT THE INSTITUTION, IN COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, IS IN PERMANENT CONTACT WITH POLICE FORCES OF OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH INTERPOL. HE SAID THAT REGARDING THE CASE OF THE MURDERED U.S. CITIZENS, THE POLICE ARE ALSO EXCHANGING INFORMATION BECAUSE THE INCIDENT IS OF AN INTERNATIONAL NATURE. HE SAID THAT HE BASED HIS DECLARATIONS ON THE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION OBTAINED SHORTLY AFTER THE CRIME. SANTAGORDA SAID THAT FOUR PERUVIANS SUSPECTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED, AND THEY WILL HAVE TO JUSTIFY THEIR PRESENCE IN BOLIVIA.",

THE FMLN PLANS THAT THE ARMED FORCES RECENTLY SEIZED INCLUDE A STRATEGY IN WHICH THE FMLN IS TO CREATE CONFUSION AMONG THE POPULATION BY NOT CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF ACTIONS AND CRIMES. UNDER THESE GUIDELINES, THE FMLN HAS NOT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS, TO INSINUATE...(CHANGES THOUGHT) TO CREATE CONFUSION OR GIVE THE IMPRESSION THIS IS A VIOLENT SITUATION THAT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN POLITICAL GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY. FORTUNATELY THERE IS EVIDENCE. THE ARMED FORCES HAVE THE DOCUMENTS THAT PROVE THAT THIS IS A STRATEGY CARRIED OUT BY TERRORIST GROUPS TO PERPETRATE THIS KIND OF ACTION AND PROVOKE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN THE COUNTRY. OTHER VALUABLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN UNCOVERED, BUT I BELIEVE IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PUBLIC SECURITY AUTHORITIES TO REVEAL THIS. TERRORISTS HAVE RECENTLY ISSUED DECLARATIONS REVEALING THIS STRATEGY, THEIR MODUS OPERANDI, AND THE PLANS THEY HAVE FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. THEY HAVE PLANS TO CONTINUE DEALING BLOWS AGAINST THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS OFFICIALS TO FORCE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE -- AS THEY DID WITH FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT. (END RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT MERINO ALSO REFERRED TO ANOTHER TOPIC IN THE NEWS, THE ANTITERRORIST LAW: (BEGIN RECORDING) (MERINO) WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN SENT TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. THERE IS (WORDS INDISTINCT) FOR THE DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, AND ANOTHER ONE THAT REFERS TO THE ANTITERRORIST LAW. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS BEEN QUITE CLEAR IN ITS POSITION, WHICH WAS STATED BY THE VICE PRESIDENCY. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS CLEARLY STATED IT CANNOT LET THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE OPERATING WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS OR CONTROLS, VIOLATING THE LAW, DISRUPTING SOCIAL LIFE, AND DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE (WORDS INDISTINCT). THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE MUST BE PROTECTED BY EFFECTIVE LAWS SO THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES CAN CONTROL THE SITUATION AND SO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE NOT INTERPRETED AS AN ABUSE OF AUTHORITY. (WORDS INDISTINCT) PENAL CODE THAT CONTEMPLATES ALL THE SENTENCES FOR TERRORIST CRIMES; HOWEVER, THEY HAVE PROVED INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE THEY MAY LACK THE PROCEDURES NEEDED IN OUR CURRENT SITUATION. THOSE LAWS DATE BACK MANY DECADES; IT WAS NEVER FORESEEN THAT EL SALVADOR COULD REACH THE CURRENT DETERIORATED SITUATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE KILLED AND THE CULPRITS CALMLY WALK AWAY. NEWSPAPERS (WORDS INDISTINCT) SAY THAT SINCE WE ARE AT WAR, IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO KILL. (REPORTER) IT IS RUMORED THAT THE LAW (PASSAGE INDISTINCT). (MERINO) THE PROVISIONS ALREADY EXIST; ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS HARMONIZE THEM. WE MUST FULFILL OUR OBLIGATION. THE CONSTITUTION (WORDS INDISTINCT) STATED THAT EVERY SECONDARY LAW SHOULD BE HARMONIZED WITH THE CONSTITUTION. IN THIS CASE, THE PENAL CODE, THE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED TO A CERTAIN POINT, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE -- IF WE ARE GOING TO ABIDE BY THE CONSTITUTION -- TO ADAPT THEM TO OUR SITUATION. (WORDS INDISTINCT) SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NO OFFICIAL OF A FRIENDLY COUNTRY CAN INTERFERE WITH THIS. I RECENTLY TOLD SOME JOURNALISTS WHO ARE MY FRIENDS THAT VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE'S GOAL WAS TO COME AND REAFFIRM HIS GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF THE NEW SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. HE DID IT ON THIS DATE BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE U.S. PRESIDENCY WHILE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS IN EUROPE. HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR WAS NOT A MERE COINCIDENCE. HE CAME TO REAFFIRM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. (END RECORDING)",

        "text": "BLOOD IS FLOWING IN COLUMBIA, MORE ABUNDANTLY EVERY YEAR. LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL STATISTICS, THERE WERE 4,600 VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE KILLED WERE PEASANTS. AN \"INTERNAL WAR,\" UNLEASHED BY THE OLIGARCHY MANY YEARS AGO, IS BEING WAGED AGAINST THEM. THE ACTIVISTS OF THE COALITION OF LEFT-WING PARTIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMUNISTS -- THE PATRIOTIC UNION -- COME NEXT, AFTER THE PEASANTS. THE PEOPLE KILLED INCLUDE JAIME PARDO LEAL, PRESIDENT OF ITS NATIONAL COORDINATION COMMITTEE, AROUND 30 DEPUTIES, AND MANY MUNICIPAL ADVISORS AND MAYORS. THE ORGANIZERS OF THE \"DIRTY WAR\" AND THE LEADERS OF THE \"DEATH SQUADS,\" AND OTHER ULTRA-RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS AND THEIR HIRED KILLERS, FEEL THAT THEY CAN GO UNPUNISHED. THE RESPONSE TO THE TERROR OF THE RIGHT HAS THE ARMED STRUGGLE WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, VICTIMS OF POLITICAL TERROR ALSO INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RULING CIRCLES AND THEIR LAW-ENFORCEMENT ORGANS, WAGING AN UNEQUAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA. AS A \"SHADOW ECONOMY,\" IT IS TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE STATE STRUCTURE. IN THE PAST YEAR THE NARCOTICS BUSINESS HAS \"ENRICHED\" THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY WITH $2 BILLION AND EVEN PROPOSED THAT IT WOULD PAY OFF THE GIGANTIC FOREIGN DEBT. THE NARCOTICS MAFIA CARRIES OUT REPRISALS AGAINST ITS OPPONENTS. THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT, A DIRECTOR OF THE BIGGEST NEWSPAPER ESPECTADOR, AND, A FEW DAYS AGO, ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, GOVERNOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTIOQUIA WERE KILLED. MANY PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY THROUGH FEAR FOR THEIR OWN LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR RELATIVES. THE VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING AND THE IMPRESSION IS BEING FORMED THAT CERTAIN FORCES ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE 30 MILLION STRONG POPULATION OF COLOMBIA AWAY FROM THE URGENT RESOLUTION OF PRESSING SOCIAL PROBLEMS BY DESTABILIZING INTERNAL LIFE. SOVIET SOCIETY, IN THE NAME OF OBSERVING BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHARITY, CONSIDERS THAT OUR CONSCIENCE CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE ORGY OF POLITICAL TERROR OVERWHELMING COLOMBIA. WE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC OF THE WORLD TO RAISE THEIR VOICES AGAINST THIS EVIL IN THE NAME OF THE COMMON SOLIDARITY OF MANKIND. DRASTIC ACTIONS ARE NEEDED PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. WE CONSIDER THAT IN COLOMBIA ITSELF, DIALOGUE BETWEEN OPPOSING SIDES THAT ARE TAKING THE STAND OF PATRIOTISM AND POLITICAL REALISM IS NECESSARY. THE FRUITFULNESS OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE HAS BEEN PROVED IN PRACTICE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS BY MANY COUNTRIES. THE VITAL INTERESTS OF THE TORMENTED COLOMBIAN PEOPLE CALL FOR CIVIL PEACE.",

IN OTHER WORDS, THE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE. THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUE WILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED. IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS. WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DO SO. THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT, ONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON. WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FOR YEARS. ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AN OVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT. THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT'S POSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST LOGICAL ONE.\" TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO SOLVE THREE PROBLEMS: THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT. HE SAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING: \"WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOME GROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN A PROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY.\" HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES LIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND LARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED. REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE AGREED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE. TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO OFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE. IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND FASTER SERVICE.\" ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED, THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIVE NORMALLY. THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME. WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL (LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION) SOLVE PROBLEMS.\" TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE HAVE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO. IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED THE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES. HE IS TO CONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC BREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX. WE HAVE TO START ELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS. ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY INCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.\" CRISTIANI ADDS: \"WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME TAX. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON REVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM'S PRESENT SITUATION. THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM'S INCOME.\" CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT INCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HE SAYS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE COUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY. REGARDING THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY VALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE. WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON. EVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO PAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 (COLONES) TO 1 (DOLLAR), THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS' DEMANDS.\" FURTHER DETAILS AS AVAILABLE.",

        "text": "1. DURING THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, CHILEAN FOREIGN RELATIONS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO PROCESSES. ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAME MORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONAL FORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A FREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THE WORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIR EXPERIENCES. 2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES' REVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THE GREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON A PROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND SOCIAL CHANGE. 3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST (SI) AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHIN THIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS. FIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLES THE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEW DAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THE CHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSE WHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THE SI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEAN CAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST AND COOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEAS AND PROPOSALS PRAISED. 4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION AND TRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALL PROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS, EXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THE EMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THE WORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OF LIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES IN THE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITS IDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS A BROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF AN AUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATE ACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLE PLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE. (CONTINUED)",

(AZCONA) I BELIEVE THAT AT THIS SUMMIT THE CENTRAL (WORDS INDISTINCT). (REPORTER) HOW, MR PRESIDENT? (AZCONA) WELL, I DO NOT KNOW. IT IS NOT EASY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WILL BE EASY TO SOLVE. (REPORTER) IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR DIALOGUE? (AZCONA) YES, BUT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE. (REPORTER) I AM THE VOZ DE NICARAGUA REPORTER. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES? (AZCONA) WELL, I READ THE AGREEMENT LAST NIGHT AND BELIEVE IT TO BE A STEP FORWARD. INCIDENTALLY, I READ IT TWICE LAST NIGHT AND IT IS A VERY LONG DOCUMENT. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE AGREEMENT WITH THE PARTIES THAT ARE TRULY OPPOSITION PARTIES AND NOT THE ONE MADE WITH THE OTHER PARTIES BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT REALLY OPPOSITION PARTIES. (REPORTER) WHAT I WANTED WAS YOUR OPINION ON THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS. (AZCONA) OH, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SMALL DOCUMENT THAT MAKES DEMANDS, DEMANDS, AND MORE DEMANDS. THIS DOCUMENT HAS NO VALUE. (REPORTER) I MEAN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED WITH THE 21 POLITICAL PARTIES... (AZCONA, INTERRUPTING) THAT AGREEMENT IS VALUABLE BUT IT DOES NOT MENTION THE CONTRA DEMOBILIZATION. THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE ABIDED BY. THIS IS THE DOCUMENT I READ TWICE, AND I BELIEVE IT IS QUITE SERIOUS AND A STEP FORWARD. (REPORTER) WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THE MERCENARIES TO LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY? (AZCONA) FIRST, I DO NOT USE DEROGATORY TERMS. THEY ARE NICARAGUANS WHO FOR DIFFERENT REASONS DISAGREE WITH THE SYSTEM IN NICARAGUA. THESE NICARAGUANS OPPOSE THE SYSTEM, AND FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS THEY HAVE TAKEN UP ARMS AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN HONDURAS. I DO NOT USE THE TERM MERCENARY. I UNDERSTAND THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT USES IT AND IT IS ALL RIGHT FOR THEM TO DO SO, BUT I WILL NOT ANSWER A QUESTION THAT USES A TERM THAT I BELIEVE IS TOO DEROGATORY. (REPORTER) THE DEMOBILIZATION PLAN HAS A VERY FIRM DEADLINE AND IS TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 90 DAYS. DO YOU THINK... (AZCONA, INTERRUPTING) NO, NO. THE 90-DAY DEADLINE IS INCLUDED IN AN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA WITH THREE SMALL NICARAGUAN LEFTIST PARTIES. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS DOCUMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT. I DO BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS. (WORDS INDISTINCT) TERRORISTS IN EL SALVADOR AND CONTRAS ARE PRESENTLY NOT ACTIVE, SO BOTH SITUATIONS -- CONTRAS AND GUERRILLAS -- ARE DIFFERENT. (REPORTER) IS IT TRUE THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS GOING TO PRESENT A PARALLEL PROGRAM AT THE SUMMIT? (AZCONA) (WORDS INDISTINCT) PRESIDENT CRISTIANI COMES TO THE SUMMIT AS EL SALVADOR'S LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT. HE HAS THE RIGHT TO PRESENT HIS POINTS OF VIEW. HE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL AS TO ONES IN HIS OWN COUNTRY. (REPORTER) IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN FOR THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WILL BE STUDIED AT THIS SUMMIT IF PRESIDENT CRISTINAI PRESENTS ONE? (AZCONA) OF COURSE. HE HAS A RIGHT TO DO SO. (CONTINUED)",

ACCORDING TO A REPORT WHICH CITES RELIABLE SOURCES, IT SEEMS THAT THE HAND OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS BEHIND THE ASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGE CARLOS VALENCIA, OF THE BOGOTA (WORDS INDISTINCT), WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY (18 AUGUST). THE COLOMBIAN DRUG MAFIA HAS CREATED A GREAT MONEY AND CRIME EMPIRE IN COLOMBIA WITH POWERFUL RAMIFICATIONS OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN CONSUMER OF COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS IN THE WORLD. YESTERDAY (18 AUGUST), VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ SPOKE ON THE PHONE WITH HIS COLOMBIAN COUNTERPART, VIRGILIO BARCO, AND IT IS SAID THAT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND DRUG TRAFFICKING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ. WE MUST REFLECT, SAID CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ON THE NEED FOR US, ALL VENEZUELANS, TO FACE DRUG TRAFFICKING IN VENEZUELA. WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING IS THE ABOMINABLE CRIME OF OUR TIMES, AND THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY HESITATION OR COMPASSION TOWARD DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ. IN REALITY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DRAMA IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. WE HAVE THE DRAMATIC CASE OF COLOMBIA, BUT THE SITUATION ALSO EXISTS IN VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA, PERU, WELL, IN SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. NOW, THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM...(REPHRASES) AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY LATIN AMERICANS THEMSELVES AND THEIR MOST PROMINENT FIGURES, THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE DRAMATIC DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM MUST BE BASED ON PUTTING AN END TO THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS. THAT IS THE MAIN STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING. THE UNITED STATES IS THE MAIN CONSUMPTION CENTER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD, AND U.S. POLICY ON DRUG TRAFFICKING IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEED TO PUT AN END AND ACTIVELY REPRESS THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS. U.S. POLICY, AND ALL THIS IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN LATIN AMERICA, IS BASED ON DESTROYING THE PLANTATIONS OF A NATIVE PLANT IN THE CONTINENT, WHICH IS COCA. PRESIDENTS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FIGURES OF THE CONTINENT HAVE SAID THAT THE SOLUTION IS NOT BASED ON THE DESTRUCTION OF A NATIVE PLANT BUT IN ACTIVE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG CONSUMPTION. I THINK THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA AND THE DRAMATIC SITUATION THAT COLOMBIA IS FACING THESE DAYS CONFIRM THAT THE POLICY FOR FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST BE TENACIOUS, STRONG, WITHOUT HESITATION AND COMPASSION. IT MUST ALSO BE BASED ON ENDING DRUG CONSUMPTION BY THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN DRUG CONSUMER OF THE WORLD -- WHICH LIVES PRECISELY FROM DRUG CONSUMPTION AND ITS BUSINESS.",

ISRAELI CHARGE D'AFFAIRS MICHEL RONEN ADMITTED THERE ARE SEVERAL ISRAELIS ENGAGED IN THAT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, BUT WARNED THAT THEY DO SO \"ON THEIR OWN AND DO NOT ACT ON BEHALF OF MY GOVERNMENT.\" MOREOVER, THIS OFFICIAL DENIED THAT JUBIZ HAZVUMB, CAPTURED 22 AUGUST BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES FOR HIS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER OF SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WAS AN ISRAELI CITIZEN. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS REVEALED BY THE PRESS, THE SUSPECT IS AN ISRAELI MERCENARY PAID BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIA -- THAT APPEARS TO BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE MURDERS OF GALAN, A HIGH-RANKING POLICE OFFICER, AND A JUDGE LAST WEEK. REPORTS DISCLOSING THE PRESENCE OF THESE TERRORISTS IN COLOMBIA APPEARED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN TELEVISION CLIPS SHOWED A MAN GIVING INSTRUCTIONS IN HEBREW TO A RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY SQUAD. SIMILAR CLIPS WERE BROADCAST BY THE U.S. TELEVISION NETWORK NBC, PROMPTING A COMMUNIQUE FROM JERUSALEM WHICH REQUESTED COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES AND INTERPOL TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION ON THE MATTER. ACORDING TO THE ISRAELI OFFICIAL, THE TERRORISTS' ACTIONS IN COLOMBIA RUN \"COUNTER TO ISRAEL'S POLICIES.\" INVESTIGATIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS) -- THE STATE'S INTELLIGENCE CORPS -- DISCLOSED THE LINKS BETWEEN THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS AND ULTRARIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS. ACCORDING TO DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, SET UP SEVERAL \"SCHOOLS FOR GUNMEN\" IN A VAST REGION IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY WITH ISRAELI, BRITISH, U.S. AND WEST GERMAN TERRORIST INSTRUCTORS. MOREOVER, NBC WARNED OF THE PRESENCE OF SOUTH AFRICANS. THE PARAMILITARY SQUADS ARE ACCUSED OF HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL MURDERS AND MASSACRES AGAINST POLITICAL AND LABOR LEADERS, AS WELL AS PEASANTS AND PATRIOTIC UNION LEFTIST MILITANTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THE AUTHORITIES ARE ACCUSING THESE SQUADS' KILLERS OF BEING BEHIND THE CRIME WAVE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING SINCE LAST WEEK, WITH THE MURDERS OF PEOPLE KNOWN FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES AGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING.",

THESE TWO COUNTRIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR COCAINE CROPS AND THE DRUG CARTEL'S ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, EXTREMIST RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL GOALS THROUGH TERRORIST ACTIVITY. HADASHOT HAS LEARNED FROM A SOURCE WHO WAS IN PERU FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS THAT ELEMENTS LINKED TO THE DRUG GROWERS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION ON MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM ISRAELI ARMS DEALERS IN 1987. THE EQUIPMENT INCLUDED GALIL RIFLES, FLAK JACKETS, AMMUNITION BELTS AND AMMUNITION, VARIOUS TYPES OF GRENADES, AND COMMUNICATIONS AND NIGHT VISION EQUIPMENT. IN 1988 AND 1989, IN ADDITIONAL DEALS WORTH SOME $6 MILLION, MORTARS, SHELLS, SNIPER RIFLES, AND AMMUNITION FOR LIGHT WEAPONS WERE PURCHASED. THE ARMS WERE SENT TO PERU VIA MEXICO AND GUATEMALA. AT LEAST 3 IDF (ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES) RESERVE OFFICERS WERE IN PERU FOR OVER 2 MONTHS IN EARLY 1988 TO ORGANIZE FIGHTING UNITS. THE PERUVIAN FIGHTERS WERE PRESENTED TO THE OFFICERS AS BELONGING TO RIGHT-WING POLITICAL BODIES IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS INCLUDED MERCENARIES FROM THE NETHERLANDS AND ENGLAND. THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS WAS MADE UP OF SOME 10 PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM WERE RECRUITED THROUGH AN ISRAELI-NETHERLANDER ARMS DEALER WHO LIVES IN AMSTERDAM. THE NETHERLANDS MEDIA IS CONDUCTING A WIDE-RANGING INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT DESPITE THE SURPRISING LACK OF INTEREST BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES IN THE AFFAIR. AT THE SAME TIME, ISRAELIS IN NEIGHBORING BOLIVIA ACTED AS INSTRUCTORS IN A COURSE ON SAFEGUARDING BUSINESSMEN, GUERRILLA WARFARE, AND REGIONAL DEFENSE. THESE ISRAELIS REACHED BOLIVIA IN THE WAKE OF AN ARMS CONSIGNMENT WORTH SOME $12 MILLION, WHICH ARRIVED IN PERU (COUNTRY AS PUBLISHED) VIA A THIRD PARTY, WHICH PURCHASED IT IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY, WHICH IN TURN HAD RECEIVED IT FROM ISRAEL. FOLLOWING THE REPORTS ON DEALS BY ISRAELIS ABROAD, THE INCOME TAX INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION HAS BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO TAX PAYMENTS ON ISRAELI ARMS DEALS AND TRAINING ABROAD. IN THE PAST 5 YEARS, THE SCOPE OF COMMISSIONS PAID TO ARMS DEALERS IS ESTIMATED AT $1 BILLION. AT LEAST HALF OF IT WENT TO BIG DEALERS, SUCH AS SHA'UL EISENBERG, MARCUS KATZ, PESAH BEN-OR, ISRACES, AND OTHERS. THEY ARE NOT UNDER SUSPICION OF TRYING TO CHEAT OR HIDE INFORMATION FROM THE TAX AUTHORITIES.",

ONE PERSON WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN EACH OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS, BUT NO DEATHS WERE REPORTED. THE DEVICE WHICH EXPLODED IN MANRIQUE DESTROYED THE BANK BUILDING AND A BUS THAT WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, AND CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE IN SEVERAL STORES NEARBY. THE EXPLOSION IN THE OTHER BRANCH WAS OF A LESSER MAGNITUDE, AND IT BROKE WINDOWS AND CAUSED DAMAGE INSIDE THE OFFICES. THE SCANT POLICE INFORMATION SAID THAT THE DEVICES WERE APPARENTLY LEFT IN FRONT OF THE TWO BANK BRANCHES MINUTES BEFORE THE CURFEW BEGAN FOR THE 6TH CONSECUTIVE DAY--PRECISELY TO COUNTER THE WAVE OF TERRORISM CAUSED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THESE REPRESENT THE SECOND AND THIRD DYNAMITE ATTACKS IN MEDELLIN THIS EVENING. THE PREVIOUS ONE TOOK PLACE 2 HOURS EARLIER AND BLEW UP A POLICE POST, BUT FAILED TO INJURE ITS FIVE OCCUPANTS.",

OUR REPORTER HERNANDO CORRALES HAS THE DETAILS: (BEGIN RECORDING) (CORRALES) IF THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF AN OPERATION NEAR PUERTO BOYACA ON 18 JULY LAST YEAR HAD NOT SABOTAGED IT, THE FOREIGN INSTRUCTORS AT THE SERVICE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL WOULD NOW BE JAIL. ON THAT DATE, MARTA LUCIA GONZALEZ, SECOND JUDGE OF PUBLIC ORDER, WROTE A FILE NOTE SAYING THAT THE JUDICIAL INSPECTION WAS UNJUSTLY TORPEDOED WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT THIS ARGUMENT WAS SENSELESS AND ILLOGICAL SINCE ABSOLUTELY NO ONE OTHER THAN THE UNDERSIGNED JUDGE COULD DECIDE IF HE OR SHE HAD ANYTHING TO INSPECT, OR IF HE OR SHE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CONDUCT THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING. THE DOCUMENT, WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE DOSSIER ON THE MASSACRE IN LA HONDURA AND LA NEGRA, URABA REGION, SAYS THAT SHE WAS LEFT 2 DAYS INSIDE A PLANE AT THE AIRPORT OF THE TEXAS PETROLEUM COMPANY IN PUERTO BOYACA AND THAT THE POLICE AUTHORITIES ACCOMPANYING HER FAILED TO EXPLAIN TO HER WHY THEY HAD NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION. (UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER) IN FACT, SHE AND SEVERAL DAS INSPECTORS ENCOUNTERED SOME OBSTACLES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS INFORMED OF THESE OBSTACLES IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION. I THINK THAT WHEN SHE AND THE DAS PERSONNEL WERE PREPARING TO GO TO PUERTO BOYACA IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE PRESENT THERE FOR THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THIS WAS QUITE WORRISOME. (CORRALES) AS IS KNOWN, JUDGE GONZALEZ HAD TO LEAVE COLOMBIA BECAUSE HER LIFE WAS THREATENED, AND HER FATHER, FORMER BOYACA GOVERNOR ALVARO GONZALEZ SANTANA, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED. MOREOVER, GEN MAZA MARQUEZ SAID FURTHER THAT THE FACT THAT A PAYMENT IS BEING OFFERED FOR THE CAPTURE OF PABLO ESCOBAR AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER PERSONS ACCUSED OF BEING CAPOS OF THE MAFIA ARE NOT BEING SOUGHT TOO. (MAZA) WE ARE TAKING ACTION THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT SHOWING ANY SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE WE INTEND TO ACT INDISCRIMINATELY. WHAT WE WANT IS TO FIGHT A SCOURGE THAT HAS GREATLY HARMED ALL COLOMBIANS. (CORRALES) THE DAS DIRECTOR SAID THAT IF ANYONE BEING HELD IN CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KILLING OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN IS RELEASED, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT PROCEEDING WELL.

(BEGIN RECORDING) (CEREZO) THERE ARE SOME STUBBORN PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE PEACEFULLY AND FREELY. THERE ARE EVEN SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE USING VIOLENCE TO IMPOSE THEIR IDEAS; THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COUNTER THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE'S IDEAS WITH CONFRONTATION AND POLARIZATION.

IT IS PERHAPS THE MOST CRUEL, HARSH, AND AUDACIOUS PLOT EVER PREPARED IN THE NATION'S 4 YEARS OF DEMOCRATIC HISTORY, BECAUSE -- AND I WANT YOU TO CAREFULLY LISTEN TO THIS -- THEY HAVE DECIDED TO KILL PROMINENT POLITICAL AND LABOR LEADERS SO THAT THE PEOPLE BLAME THE GOVERNMENT -- REMEMBERING THE TRAGEDIES WHICH OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND THE ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTS WHICH DECIDED TO KEEP, WITH DEATH AND REPRESSION, THE PRIVILEGES THAT THEY HAD NOT EARNED. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A RIFT BETWEEN THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT; THEY WANT US TO FALL INTO A TRAP.

HE SAID NO ONE SHOULD CONDEMN HIS GOVERNMENT WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION. PRESIDENT CEREZO ALSO PLEDGED TO USE EVERY AVAILABLE MEANS TO LOCATE THOSE WHO PERPETRATE ACTS OF TERRORISM.

GEN VARGAS HAS SAID THAT THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED IN THE ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE AT SUBA MUNICIPALITY LAST NIGHT HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. (VARGAS) TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND FIVE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK. THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED ARE YET TO BE IDENTIFIED. THOSE WOUNDED INCLUDE THREE EMPLOYEES OF THE GAS STATION WHERE THE CAR BOMB WENT OFF AND TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING BY THE GAS STATION AT THE MOMENT OF THE EXPLOSION. PRELIMINARY REPORTS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED 70 MILLION PESOS IN LOSSES. (CARRILLO) GENERAL, APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY KILOGRAMS OF EXPLOSIVES WERE IN THE CAR BOMB? (VARGAS) APPARENTLY IT CONTAINED 60 KG OF DYNAMITE. THE DYNAMITE WAS PLACED INSIDE AN OLD STATION WAGON. SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INSIDE THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION -- THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED. APPARENTLY THE CAR BOMB WENT OFF BY ACCIDENT. IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE OFF AT THAT GAS STATION. (CARRILLO) HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED BEEN IDENTIFIED? (VARGAS) NO, NOT YET. WE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY THEM NOW. (CARRILLO) ARE THERE SPECIAL SECURITY MEASURES TO COUNTER THIS WAVE OF TERRORISM? (VARGAS) YES, OF COURSE. WE ARE CARRYING OUT A SERIES OF JOINT ACTIONS WITH THE BOGOTA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY PERSONNEL TO NEUTRALIZE TERRORIST ACTIONS. WE ARE CARRYING OUT THOSE ACTIONS IN AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL OR VULNERABLE AND IN OTHER AREAS WHERE WE ARE COUNTERACTING AND NEUTRALIZING TERRORIST ACTIONS, AS I TOLD YOU. (CARRILLO) ARE THERE SECRET AGENTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CITY? (VARGAS) YES, WE HAVE UNIFORMED AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL GUARDING THE CITY RIGHT NOW. WE ALSO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE BOGOTA POLICE DEPARTMENT, OF DIJIN (DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS), AND OF CIJIN (EXPANSION UNKNOWN). THEY ARE COOPERATING WITH US. THEY ARE GUARDING AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL OR PLACES THAT COULD BE TARGETS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS. (CARRILLO) WHAT OTHER MEASURES HAVE YOU ADOPTED ALONG WITH THE 13TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE BOGOTA MAYOR? (VARGAS) WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES, SUCH AS INCREASING PERSONNEL ON THE STREETS AND HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CHEKCKPOINTS IN AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL AND ARE CARRYING OUT A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT WILL HELP US LOCATE THESE CRIMINALS.",

COL PONCE SAID THAT WITH THIS ATTITUDE THE REBELS ARE NOT SHOWING A REAL DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND HE DESCRIBED IT AS A PROPAGANDISTIC ACTION. TODAY, DURING HIS TOUR OF VARIOUS AREAS OF CONFLICT, COL PONCE SAID THAT RECENT FMLN ATTACKS ON VARIOUS MILITARY POSITIONS AS PART OF ITS LATEST CAMPAIGN FOLLOWING THE UNILATERAL TRUCE WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE ON THE PART OF THE REBEL COMMANDERS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE MIDST OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS CONTINUOUS. (BEGIN RECORDING) (PONCE) THAT SHOWS THERE ARE, ON THE ONE HAND, THE PROPOSALS AND WHAT THE TERRORIST LEADERS CALL THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE REAL ACTIONS. I THINK THAT THE CAMPAIGN THE FMLN HAS MOUNTED NATIONWIDE WAS A BAD STEP, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SHOW A REAL AND SINCERE DESIRE TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. (END RECORDING) COLONEL PONCE ADDED THAT THE REQUEST FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TROOPS AS STATED IN THE GUERRILLA PROPOSAL IS A POLITICAL MOVE. HE PLAYED DOWN THE LATEST REBEL OFFER PRESENTED TO THE GOVERNMENT IN MEXICO. (BEGIN RECORDING) (PONCE) THE PROPOSAL WAS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE FMLN'S IMAGE ABROAD, WHICH HAD DETERIORATED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE PROPOSAL CAN BE DISCUSSED; HOWEVER, WE IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT THE ONES WHO WILL DISCUSS IT OR WHO WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT CAN OR CANNOT BE ACCEPTED. IT IS A POLITICAL DECISION, AND THE ARMED FORCES WILL ACCEPT THE DECISION MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE MILITARY COMMANDERS ARE NOT THE ONES WHO MUST DECIDE ON THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THE INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE. THIS IS A DECISION TO BE MADE BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS AND THREATS THE COUNTRY MAY BE FACING. (END RECORDING) COLONEL PONCE VISITED THE POSITIONS OF THE ARMY'S BELLOSO AND ATLACATL ELITE BATTALIONS IN THE TOWNS OF PERQUIN IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT AND LA LAGUNA IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, NEAR THE HONDURAN BORDER, WHERE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE. DURING THIS MILITARY TOUR, COL PONCE SAID THAT IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS NO LIBERATED OR PERMANENTLY OCCUPIED TERRITORY IN EL SALVADOR. HOWEVER, THE REBELS CLAIM THEY CONTROL THAT AREA OF INTENSE CONFLICT WHERE THE WAR HAS LEFT ITS INDELIBLE MARK.",

ASKING FOR AN END TO THE WAR AND NEGOTIATIONS IS LIKE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CHANGED WITHOUT HAVING WON THE WAR. IN ADDITION TO BEING UNREALISTIC, THIS IS A FORMULA FOR NOT NEGOTIATING AND CONTINUING THE WAR. IN THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENTS, THE GOVERNMENTS URGE THE SIDES TO AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE. THE TELA ACCORDS ALSO APPEAL TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ESQUIPULAS II ACCORDS. THIS PARTICULAR AGREEMENT LINKS THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES TO DEMOCRATIZATION, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION AS A HARMONIOUS, INDIVISIBLE WHOLE. THIS CONCEPT IS SUPPORTED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN ITS RESOLUTION 637 OF 27 JULY 1989. IN ADDITION, THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE MEXICAN ACCORD READS AS FOLLOWS: THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL TALK IN AN EFFORT TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS TO CONCLUDE THE ARMED CONFLICT THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL FOSTER THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION AND REUNITE SALVADORAN SOCIETY. THE DIALOGUE IS MEANT TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES. THE AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED IN MEXICO SAYS NOTHING OF TALKING ABOUT OR NEGOTIATING THE FMLN'S DEMOBILIZATION BUT MENTIONS NEGOTIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE DEMOCRATIZATION TO AGREE ON THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES. BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, CRISTIANI IS CLOSING THE DOOR TO DEMOCRATIZATION. THIS, PLUS HIS REFUSAL TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN, MAKES HIM GUILTY OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MADE AT ESQUIPULAS. 3. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMITMENT WE MADE IN MEXICO AND WITH THE REGIONAL ACCORDS, WE REITERATE OUR FULL WILLINGNESS TO AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AND TO ATTEND THE UPCOMING NEGOTIATION MEETING IN COSTA RICA. FOR THIS MEETING, WE HAVE INCLUDED IN OUR PEACE PROPOSAL AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; CESSATION OF REPRESSION; TRIAL OF BOTH THOSE GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THOSE FOUND TO BE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS; ENFORCEMENT OF THE 1980 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS; AND SUSPENSION OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT EXACERBATE THE CRISIS AND THE WAR; PURGE OF THE ARMY; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS; HOLDING THE 1991 ELECTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE; MINIMUM OPERATIONAL GUARANTEES TO ESTABLISH GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS FOR THE FORCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE. AFTER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE OF THE UN AND OAS SECRETARY GENERALS' REPRESENTATIVES, WHO WILL SERVE AS WITNESSES AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE, CRISTIANI AGREED TO INVITE THEM TO THE COSTA RICA MEETING. WE HOPE HE KEEPS HIS WORD BECAUSE THIS WILL LEND SERIOUSNESS TO THE PROCESS AND GUARANTEE THE NEGOTIATIONS INITIATED IN MEXICO. SIGNED THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND",

THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR BERTRAN SHERR IT \"CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD AS BEING OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL INTEREST.\" THE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE EVENTUAL REMOVAL OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT AND ITS REPLACEMENT BY A NEW MEMBER WILL BE DECIDED THIS WEDNESDAY IN ICA (PERU) DURING THE SUMMIT OF THE PRESIDENTS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, PERU, URUGUAY, AND VENEZUELA. PANAMA'S ROLE IN THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF THAT COUNTRY'S CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION. THE SAME SOURCE DISMISSED THE IDEA THAT PERU MAY BE PLANNING TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PANAMA BECAUSE THIS WOULD AFFECT PERU'S LINKS WITH THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND \"THIS IS NOT THE POSITION OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBER COUNTRIES.\" PANAMA HAS HAD AN AMBASSADOR IN PERU FOR 40 YEARS, BUT ONLY FOR \"PERSONAL REASONS\". IN THE PRIVATE DIALOGUE WITH EFE, THE SOURCE SAID THAT \"THE PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR SEEMINGLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGES SENT BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH ITS RECENT ACTIONS.\" IN EARLY SEPTEMBER THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT REMOVED ITS AMBASSADOR TO PANAMA, MR MARIO CASTRO ARENAS, FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AND DOWNGRADED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES TO THE LEVEL OF CHARGE D'AFFAIRES. PERU DID THIS AFTER ANNOUNCING THAT IT WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT HEADED BY FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ. ASKED IF THE PANAMANIAN DIPLOMAT WOULD BE INVITED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, THE SOURCE SAID THAT \"THIS HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED BECAUSE THAT WOULD IMPLY BREAKING RELATIONS WITH PANAMA, AND PERU DOES NOT WANT TO GO THAT FAR.\" IN COMMENTS TO A TELEVISION REPORTER LAST SUNDAY IN LIMA, FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL PROPOSE THE DEFINITIVE EXPULSION OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT. THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, URUGUAY, AND PERU BEGAN A 2-DAY MEETING IN TRUJILLO TODAY AND THEIR AGENDA INCLUDES THE SITUATION IN PANAMA, THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, THE FOREIGN DEBT, AND THE INTEGRATION PROCESS. TRUJILLO, 550 KILOMETERS NORTH OF LIMA, IS NORMALLY A QUIET AREA, BUT IT NOW GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF BEING A MILITARIZED CITY. THIS MILITARY PRESENCE IS AIMED AT DETERRING SABOTAGE AND ATTACKS BY TERRORIST GROUPS. AT LEAST 5,000 POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS ARE GUARDING ALL ENTRANCES TO THE CITY. THERE IS EVEN HEAVIER SECURITY AT THE PLAZA DE ARMAS ZONE, WHERE THE FOREIGN MINISTERS WILL MEET. NO VEHICLES OR PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED IN THAT AREA.",

        "text": "THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE COMBINING OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE JUST ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DEMANDS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THESE 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP. THESE DEMANDS ARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, AND EFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDING TORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE ONCE AGAIN COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOW THAT MANY RIGHTIST CANDIDATES ARE DEMAGOGICALLY ATTEMPTING TO POSE AS DEFENDERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SINCE EL MERCURIO HAS REPORTED THAT THE DICTATOR IS PLANNING TO CONVERT THE CNI (NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER) INTO AN AGENCY OF THE ARMY SO THAT THE MAIN REPRESSIVE BODY FROM ALL THESE YEARS CAN BE UNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL. JAIME INZUNZA, LEADER OF THE UNITED LEFT AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE, DISCUSSES THESE TOPICS OVER A DIRECT PHONE LINE FROM SANTIAGO, CHILE. (BEGIN RECORDING) (ANNOUNCER) HOW ARE THE CHILEAN PEOPLE'S DEMANDS CONNECTED TO THE ONGOING ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN? (INZUNZA) THEY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD BOARDS DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS; THE STRENGTHENING OF THE UNIFIED ACTIONS OF WORKERS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEES FOR VICTORY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE COMMITTEES FOR THE DEFENSE OF VICTORY AND COMMITTEES FOR CARRYING ON THE DEMOCRATIC TASK; THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONFIDENCE; THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND IMMUNITY FOR CRIMES; THE INCREASING PRESSURE BY THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND NATURALLY FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI. ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED WITHIN SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. THIS WAS EVIDENCED A WEEK AGO BY THE SALVADORA STRIKE AND BY THE CURRENT STRIKE BY COAL MINERS. THIS PROVES THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND A WAY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE FUTURE STRUGGLE. (END RECORDING) THE PRECEDING COMMENTS WERE MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER JAIME INZUNZA, WHO HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED OVER THE TELEPHONE ON OUR PROGRAM \"ESCUCHA CHILE.\" ANOTHER TOPIC DISCUSSED BY INZUNZA WAS THE EL MERCURIO REPORT ON THE CNI'S TRANSFER TO THE ARMY. THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF CHILEANS. (BEGIN RECORDING) (ANNOUNCER) WHAT IS YOUR OPINION, JAIME INZUNZA, ON THE DICTATOR'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE CNI AS IT IS AND TO KEEP IT UNDER HIS DIRECT COMMAND? (INZUNZA) I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS. THE INTENTION IS TO MAINTAIN INTACT THE MAIN TERRORIST APPARATUS OF THE DICTATORSHIP, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DINA (NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, REPLACED BY CNI) AND THE CNI HAVE BEEN IN FACT A SINGLE APPARATUS AND THEREFORE THE MAIN ORGANS OF STATE TERRORRISM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS. IF TRANSFERRED TO THE ARMY, THE CNI WOULD CONTINUE TO BE UNDER PINOCHET'S ORDERS. UNDER WHOSE ORDERS HAS IT BEEN ALL THESE YEARS? FOR WHOM HAS IT BEEN A DIRECT AGENT ALL THESE YEARS? HENCEFORTH IT WILL BE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY. (END RECORDING) COMMUNIST LEADER JAIME INZUNZA ADDED THAT PINOCHET'S INTENT IN TRANSFERRING THE CNI TO THE ARMY'S DIRECT COMMAND IS TO MAKE THE INSTITUTION AN ACCOMPLICE IN CONCEALING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. (BEGIN RECORDING) (INZUNZA) THE IDEA IS TO INVOLVE THE MILITARY INSTITUTION IN CRIMES FOR WHICH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE KNOWS IT WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE. THIS IS CLEAR: WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FORCES WANT IS TO HAVE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THOSE CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS PROSECUTED, NOT THE MILITARY INSTITUTION. THE TRANSFER OF THE CNI TO THE ARMY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MEN IN UNIFORM ACT AS ACCOMPLICES OR ACCESSORIES TO THOSE CRIMES. LOYALTY IS NOT AT STAKE HERE; LOYALTY IS DEFENDING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, NOT SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL COMPLICITY THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE TRAINING OF THESE MEN. THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PARTICULARLY SERIOUS BECAUSE THIS TRANSFER IMPLIES MAINTAINING THE CNI UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED ALL THESE YEARS, THE DICTATOR HIMSELF. (END RECORDING) THESE HAVE BEEN ANSWERS GIVEN BY JAIME INZUNZA, UNITED LEFT AND COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER, TO QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM OVER THE PHONE BY \"ESCUCHA CHILE,\" A RADIO MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM.",

        "text": "GUATEMALAN ARCHBISHOP PROSPERO PENADOS DEL BARRIO TODAY REPORTED THE KIDNAPPING OF A NUN, DIANA MACK ORTIZ, 20 YEARS OLD, BORN IN THE STATE OF COLORADO IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE ARCHBISHOP ALSO REPORTED THAT ANOTHER U.S. NUN, PATRICIA DENNY, LEFT GUATEMALA 17 DAYS AGO BECAUSE OF CONTINUOUS DEATH THREATS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND IN WRITING. PENADOS SAID DIANA MACK ORTIZ WAS KIDNAPPED ON 2 NOVEMBER IN ANTIGUA GUATEMALA, 45 KM SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, WHEN SHE WAS ATTENDING A SEMINAR ALONG WITH OTHER NUNS. THE ARCHBISHOP EXPLAINED THE NUN HAD BEEN RECEIVING DEATH THREATS. SHE HAD BEEN URGED TO LEAVE GUATEMALA, BUT SHE DECIDED TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THIS COUNTRY. THE KIDNAPPED NUN, WHO HAD BEEN IN GUATEMALA FOR A YEAR, WAS TEACHING AT THE SAN MIGUEL ACATAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN HUEHUETENANGO DEPARTMENT IN NORTHEAST GUATEMALA. SHE BELONGS TO THE ORDER OF THE URSILINA, PENADOS REPORTED. PATRICIA DENNY, 54, LEFT GUATEMALA AFTER UNIDENTIFIED MEN WARNED HER THAT IF SHE WISHED TO CONTINUE LIVING SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. DENNY HAD ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA IN 1984, BELONGED TO THE SISTERS OF MARY KNOLL, AND WAS WORKING AT A PARISH IN MIXCO MUNICIPALITY IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY. THE ARCHBISHOP SAID ALL THIS IS THE \"BEGINNING OF A CAMPAIGN TO INTIMIDATE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.\" HE DID NOT MENTION WHICH GROUPS ARE PERPETRATING THESE INTIMIDATION ACTIONS. HOWEVER, PENADOS SAID HE IS GOING TO TALK TO GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY TO REPORT THE INCIDENTS WITH THE U.S. NUNS. PENADOS STATED THAT THIS KIND OF ACTION \"HARMED CATHOLICISM VERY MUCH IN PAST YEARS,\" WHEN REPRESSION SEVERELY HIT THIS SECTOR. HE POINTED OUT THAT THIS KIND OF INCIDENT HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOOK OVER POWER IN GUATEMALA ON 14 JANUARY 1986. THE ARCHBISHOP DEMANDED THAT MACK ORTIZ' KIDNAPPERS RESPECT HER LIFE AND PHYSICAL INTEGRITY.",

(BEGIN RECORDING) (HANDAL) OF COURSE, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS IF IT WERE WITHDRAWING SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. WE WERE JUST SAYING THAT ARONSON HAD ARRIVED AND HE LOOKED WORRIED. THE NICE LOOKING GLASS HOUSE THEY HAD BUILT HAS RAPIDLY BEGUN TO FALL APART. ARONSON APPARENTLY CAME TO SEE HOW HE COULD PATCH THINGS UP. WE RECALL A SIMILAR HIGH-LEVEL VISIT BACK AROUND 1984, IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT, WHEN THE CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENT ARRIVED. AT THAT TIME HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, NO, THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, AND CAME TO SEE HOW TO IMPROVE THE SUPPOSEDLY CENTRIST GOVERNMENT AND HOW TO PUT AN END TO THE DEATH SQUADS. HE TOOK A LIST BACK WITH HIM...(CHANGES THOUGHT) LET US TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY OPERATE. WHEN THEY TAKE ANY ACTION THEY ARE VERY CLEAR AND DIRECT. THEY HAD A POLITICAL INTEREST IN PUTTING ALL THIS TOGETHER, SO BUSH TOOK BACK WITH HIM A LIST OF 15 MILITARY MEMBERS SO THEY COULD BE FIRED. (END RECORDING)",

        "text": "THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS ASSURED TODAY THEY HAVE \"CONSOLIDATED\" FOUR OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR WHERE SOME 300,000 PERSONS LIVE. COMMANDER AMILCAR, ONE OF THE REBEL CHIEFS WHO HAS OCCUPIED THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT HE AND HIS MEN CAME TO SAN SALVADOR \"PREPARED, AND WITH SUFFICIENT AMMUNITION TO REMAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS.\" IN A GENERAL ASSESEMENT OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, THE YOUNG COMMANDER SAID THAT THE ARMY \"CANNOT ENTER\" THE \"AREA UNDER REBEL CONTROL,\" BUT IT IS ATTACKING THE REBELS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS AND USING HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS. \"HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE TRUMP CARD (FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE OFFENSIVE),\" HE ADDED. AMILCAR, WHO IS 26-YEARS-AGO AND LOOKS LIKE A STUDENT, WAS WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAYS OF ONE OF THE CRAMPED FIVE-STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN ZACAMIL WHILE EXPLAINING THAT THE GOAL OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE IS \"TO SEEK OPTIONS FOR BUILDING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.\" HE ADDED THAT THE GUERRILLAS SEEK \"TO DISRUPT THE DIALOGUE CONDITIONS, AND GO TO THE CONVERSATIONS WITH A POLITICAL AND MILITARY ADVANTAGE SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL AGREE WITH US ON WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT: DEMOCRACY, A PEOPLE'S ECONOMIC POLICY, AND A PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.\" THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR HAVE HELD TWO MEETINGS IN RECENT MONTHS, THE FIRST ONE IN MEXICO AND THE SECOND ONE IN COSTA RICA. A THIRD MEETING WAS TO BE HELD SHORTLY IN VENEZUELA, BUT THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL NOT ATTEND. THE FMLN LAUNCHED THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY OFFENSIVE SINCE 1981 ON 11 NOVEMBER, ATTACKING 50 MILITARY POSITIONS, 20 OF THEM IN SAN SALVADOR. IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS, THE OFFENSIVE HAS CAUSED NEARLY 300 CASUALTIES (127 DEAD AND 155 WOUNDED) ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND OVER 400 CASUALTIES ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS. THE OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN NAMED \"OUT WITH THE FASCISTS! FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!\" IN HOMAGE TO A TRADE UNION LEADER KILLED 13 DAYS AGO ALONG WITH NINE OTHER WORKERS IN A DYNAMITE EXPLOSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY ATTRIBUTED TO THE ULTRARIGHTIST DEATH SQUADS. ARMED WITH AN AUTOMATIC AK-47 RIFLE, AMILCAR SAID THAT THE FMLN \"HAS CONSOLIDATED THE ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, MEJICANOS, AND PANAMA NEIGHBORHOODS, AND WE HAVE BESIEGED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.\" ALL THE PLACES HE MENTIONED ARE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE BLOODIEST CLASHES BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE TAKEN PLACE. AT NIGHTFALL ON 12 NOVEMBER AND PRIOR TO THE CURFEW THAT BEGINS AT 2000 (0200 GMT), THE RESIDENTS OF ZACAMIL WERE OUTSIDE THEIR BUILDINGS CARRYING CANDLES AS THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY. AMILCAR ASSURED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE INFLICTED AT LEAST 18 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THAT AREA AND HAVE SEIZED ABOUT 20 RIFLES AND 1 M-60 MACHINEGUN. \"THIS OFFENSIVE IS A MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT. AS A RESULT OF THE CLOSING OF THE COMALAPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, THE MAIN AIRPORT OF THE COUNTRY, WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN LETTING THE WORLD THAT WE ARE AT WAR AND ARE AN EMERGING POWER,\" THE REBEL COMMANDER SAID. COMALAPA AIRPORT, LOCATED 50 KM SOUTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WAS CLOSED \"FOR SECURITY REASONS.\" ACORDING TO THE FMLN CLANDESTINE STATION, RADIO VENCEREMOS, THE GUERRILLA FIGHTERS DESTROYED THREE MILITARY HELICOPTERS ON THE GROUND AND CAUSED SOME DAMAGE ON THE AIRPORTS'S MAIN LANDING STRIP. REFERRING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A CURFEW AND A NATIONWIDE STATE OF SIEGE EFFECTIVE TONIGHT, COMMANDER AMILCAR SAID: \"WE HAD ALREADY TAKEN THIS INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE OFFENSIVE.\" THE GOVERNMENT \"CANNOT ACT INDISCRIMINATELY AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION,\" AMILCAR SAID; ADDING THAT \"THE CITIZENS' RIGHTS WERE SUSPENDED TO BOMB THE PLACES TAKEN OVER BY OUR FORCES.\" THE PEOPLE OF ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED NORTH OF THE CAPITAL HAVE LIVED IN TERROR SINCE SATURDAY, 11 NOVEMBER, WHEN THEY WERE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE MILITARY, SUBJECTED TO THE AIR RAIDS AND THE THREAT THAT LIVING WITH THE GUERRILLA MEMBERS REPRESENTS TO THEM. AT LEAST TWO CIVILIANS HAVE DIED IN ZACAMIL AND FIVE MORE HAVE BEEN WOUNDED, INCLUDING TWO CHILDREN, AS A RESULT OF THE ARMED CLASHES.",

FOUR ENEMY CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED. WE REPEAT: AN ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER WAS DESTROYED BY OUR FIGHTERS IN SAN MIGUEL. OUR FIGHTERS USED AN RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHER TO DESTROY THE ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. NOW WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION FROM SAN SALVADOR. AT 0800 1400 GMT THIS MORNING, A C-47 PLANE FLEW OVER AND STRAFED THE MEJICANOS DOWNTOWN AREA, WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT WE RECEIVED, MANY CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN INJURED. WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT THE C-47 LEFT THE AREA AFTER ITS ATTACK. WE ONCE AGAIN CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PRESSURE ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT TO STOP THIS KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. THESE ACTIONS ARE DIRECTED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THE ARMED FORCES HAS BEEN SHELLING AND STRAFING DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR SINCE SATURDAY. IN THE PAST WE HAVE DENOUNCED INDISCRIMINATE SHELLING OF RURAL AREAS; HOWEVER, THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS. THIS SHELLING AND BOMBING HAS ALREADY RESULTED IN MANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.",

OUR FORCES ARE CLASHING WITH THE ZACAMIL BATTALION. WE HAVE A REPORT FROM THE CAPITAL SAYING THAT THIS AFTERNOON, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) FORCES WERE STRONGLY ATTACKING ZACAMIL BATTALION TROOPS. THE FMLN TROOPS ARE HARASSING THE JOINT STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES AT THIS TIME. BARRICADES ARE BEING SET UP THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL ON THIS 4TH DAY OF FIGHTING. THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK ON THE JOINT STAFF IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS BECAUSE, AS WE SAID LAST NIGHT, FMLN TROOPS INITIATED ATTACKS AGAINST THE SAN BENITO BATTALION AT THE INTERNATIONAL FAIR AND AGAINST THE FORCES DEFENDING THE JOINT STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES. THIS IS THE SECOND ATTACK AGAINST THE JOINT STAFF, WHICH COMPLICATES THE OVERALL SITUATION FOR THE ARMED FORCES IN THE CAPITAL. WE ARE ATTACKING THE TOP COMMAND OF THE ENEMY FORCES. FMLN FORCES ARE ATTACKING THE HEART AND THE BRAIN OF THE ENEMY. SALVADORAN AIR FORCE PLANES ARE OVERFLYING AREAS NORTH OF THE CAPITAL, AND THEY CONTINUE MACHINEGUNNING AND BOMBING CIVILIAN AREAS. A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE REPORTED HEAVY BOMBING IN ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.",

THIS REPORT IS INCLUDED IN A GOVERNMENT DECREE APPROVED BY PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA. ACCORDING TO INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY RAUL LOAYZA, POLICE ARRESTED 500 TEACHERS AND EDUCATION LEADERS IN THE NINE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS, THUS THWARTING THE EXTENDED HUNGER STRIKE. THE STRIKE BY TEACHERS, WHO HAVE BEEN DEMANDING A BONUS OF 300 BOLIVIAN PESOS, HAS UNLEASHED VIOLENT STREET CONFRONTATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AND AT LEAST FOUR BOMBINGS. THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN BESIEGED BY A WAVE OF SOCIAL DEMANDS AND PRESSURED BY THE 80,000 TEACHERS, HAS STATED THAT THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE UNDERMINING DEMOCRATIC STABILITY. IT ADDED THAT DESPITE EFFORTS TO FIND A PATH TO PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AND DIALOGUE, IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO PREVENT RADICAL GROUPS INTERESTED IN THE UNION LEADERSHIP FROM PUBLICLY CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT DECREE STATES THAT IT WILL GUARANTEE THE 3 DECEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AND PROTECT THE CITIZENS' RIGHT TO VOTE. A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THIS DECREE TO THE PRESS, POLICE PATROLS RAIDED THE CENTERS WHERE THE HUNGER STRIKES WERE TAKING PLACE. POLICE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE IN THESE RAIDS. THE 250 STRIKERS ARRESTED IN LA PAZ WERE TAKEN IN TRUCKS AND BUSES OF THE POLICE, THE AIR FORCE, AND OTHER STATE INSTITUTIONS, TO THE EL ELTO AIR BASE. THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED THAT 250 STRIKERS WERE ALSO ARRESTED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY. IT ADDED THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRIKE WILL BE SENT TO DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. OTHER, LESS RESPONSIBLE GROUPS OF STRIKERS WILL BE TRIED BY THE REGULAR COURTS. OTHERS WILL BE RELEASED. THE THREE LA PAZ TEACHERS' LEADERS HAVE BEEN SENT TO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS IN LA PAZ AND PLACED IN INTENSIVE CARE. THEY ARE MIGUEL LORA, TELMO ROMAN, AND LUIS ALVAREZ, WHO ARE NOT FACING ANY RISK OF DEATH, THE INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY STATED. HE WARNED THAT THE BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION UNDERGROUND SESSIONS WILL BE ILLEGAL, AND THEY ARE NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, HE SAID. THIS IS THE FIRST SOCIAL CRISIS PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA HAS HAD TO FACE SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ALMOST 100 DAYS AGO.",

IGNORING A MARTIAL LAW PROHIBITING ALL TRAVEL, EARLY THIS MORNING A LARGE NUMBER OF HEAVILY ARMED SOLDIERS BURST INTO THE RESIDENCE OF THE PRIESTS WHO MANAGE THE JOSE SIMEON CANAS CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY (UCA). THE SOLDIERS BROKE INTO THE PRIESTS' BEDROOMS, CAPTURED THEM, AND BRUTALLY MURDERED THEM IN THE GARDEN. THE VICTIMS OF THIS HATEFUL COLLECTIVE CRIME WERE: PRIEST AND DR IGNACIO ELLACURIA, THE UCA DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR IGNACIO MARTIN BARO, UCA DEPUTY DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR SEGUNDO MONTES, UCA HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE DIRECTOR; PRIEST AND DR AMANDO LOPEZ, UCA DEAN; PRIEST JUAN RAMON MORENO; AND JOAQUIN LOPEZ Y LOPEZ, AS WELL AS JULIA RAMOS AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ELVA RAMOS. THE PERSONS WHO ORDERED THE HORRIBLE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THREE SALVADORAN CITIZENS ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ORDERED PILOTS, ARTILLERY MEN, AND MACHINEGUNNERS IN PLANES TO ATTACK THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. THEY ARE THE SAME ONES WHO ARE AGAINST REACHING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT. THEY ARE THE TOP MILITARY AND POLITICAL FIGURES IN ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION. THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION AND PROTECTION SECRETARIAT CALLS ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO TIE THE HANDS OF THESE MURDERERS OF SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND TO AID IN FINDING A SOLUTION TO THE NATIONAL CRISIS SO WE MAY ATTAIN A JUST AND LASTING PEACE OUR PEOPLE SO DESIRE. NO MORE BARBARIC ACTIONS IN SAN SALVADOR. NO MORE INJUSTICES. TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT FOR THE MURDERERS. THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL LEADERS OF CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT MUST BE OUSTED.

AN OFFENSIVE WAS LAUNCHED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY; HOWEVER, SAN SALVADOR'S CITY BLOCKS, WHICH WERE THE SCENE OF FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN FMLN DETACHMENTS AND GOVERNMENT TROOPS, WERE THE EPICENTER OF SUNDAY'S EVENTS. THE INTENSE FIREFIGHT INVOLVING ARTILLERY AND HELICOPTERS LASTED APPROXIMATELY 18 HOURS AND ENCOMPASSED VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE CAPITAL, COMPLETELY PARALYZING LIFE IN THE CITY. ACCORDING TO REUTER, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO STORM PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S OFFICIAL AND PERSONAL RESIDENCES; HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT HURT. REPORTS OF THE LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES ARE CONTRADICTORY. A STATE OF SIEGE HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN EL SALVADOR AND CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. A CURFEW IS IN FORCE IN THE CAPITAL, AND THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT HAS BEEN CLOSED. ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHOSE SPEECH WAS BROADCAST ON THE RADIO, THESE STEPS ARE NEEDED TO \"DEFEND THE POPULATION AGAINST LEFT-WING TERRORISM.\" ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT, THE MILITARY ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION; HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED FROM SAN SALVADOR THAT THESE WORDS BY A. CRISTIANI WERE HEARD ON THE AIRWAVES ACCOMPANIED BY CONTINUAL EXPLOSIONS AND SHOOTING. INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS REGARD EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INTERRUPTED TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURGENTS. THE THIRD ROUND OF THESE TALKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD RECENTLY IN CARACAS, BUT OPPOSITION REPRESENTATIVES REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN THEM AFTER A LEFT-WING TRADE UNION'S HEADQUARTERS WAS SUBJECTED TO ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENT RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO THE INSURGENTS, THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED ON DIALOGUE WITH THEM SOLELY OUT OF PROPAGANDA CONSIDERATIONS, WITH NO INTENTION OF REACHING ANY AGREEMENT. SUNDAY'S OFFENSIVE WAS THUS AN ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART TO SHOW THEMSELVES TO BE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. IN THE OPINION OF OBSERVERS, HOWEVER, EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR PRACTICALLY RULE OUT ALL HOPES OF SUCCESS FOR FUTURE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INSURGENTS. MOREOVER, THE FIGHTING IN THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL, A REUTER CORRESPONDENT BELIEVES, DEALT THE FRAGILE PEACE SETTLEMENT PROCESS IN CENTRAL AMERICA A CONSIDERABLE BLOW.",

ONE DAY THOSE RUINS WILL BECOME THE EVIDENCE WE WILL SHOW OUR CHILDREN TO PROVE THAT FASCISM ONCE EXISTED IN THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE U.S. IMPERIALISM'S CLUMSINESS GOES EVEN FURTHER. THE NORTH AMERICANS APPARENTLY WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN A LARGE-SCALE CONFLICT -- FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS WHO HAVE ALREADY EARNED THE WORLD'S SCORN -- GIVEN THE DECISION TO SEND U.S. PILOTS TO BOMB THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY NIGHT. THE FASCIST SALVADORAN DICTATORSHIP HAS UNLEASHED THE BRUTAL TACTICS USED BY SOMOZA BEFORE LEAVING POWER. ON THAT OCCASION THE U.S. IMPERIALISM TURNED ITS BACK ON THE TYRANT. THE UNITED STATES' FOREIGN POLICY HAVE NEVER STOOPED SO LOW AND THE DECISIONS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE NEVER BROUGHT THE POSSIBILITY OF A REGIONAL CONFLICT SO CLOSE. WHAT DOES THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT THINK ABOUT THE AIRPLANES BEING FLOWN BY U.S. PILOTS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED KM FROM ITS BORDER? WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF GUATEMALA CONTINUES TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT? THE CONSEQUENCES ARE UNFORESEEABLE. THE U.S. IMPERIALISM HAS SOILED ITS HANDS WITH A NEW GENOCIDE IN EL SALVADOR. THE U.S. PEOPLE SHOULD DEEPLY REFLECT ABOUT THIS AND STOP THEIR GOVERNMENT FROM PROVOKING CONTEMPT OF THAT NATION -- WHICH IS BEING DISINFORMED AND INTOXICATED BY THE ANTI-COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA. LARGE GROUPS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S PEOPLE, THE BEST SONS OF THE UNITED STATES, HAVE REACTED AND HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS --DEEP INSIDE THE U.S. IMPERIALISM'S HEART. SOON, VERY SOON, THIS WILL BECOME AN UNSTOPPABLE SURGE. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC GOAL IS CLEAR: THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO (WORDS INDISTINCT). TO QUOTE MONSIGNOR (OSCAR ARNULFO) ROMERO, THE ARMY -- AND IN THIS CASE THE NORTH AMERICANS -- ARE LIKE SERPENTS, WHICH ONLY BITE THE SHOELESS. YET THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN IN ANGER AND DIGNITY, AND THEY ARE COMING TO PULL OUT THE FASCIST SERPENT'S FANGS.",

        "text": "HEAVY CLASHES ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW IN ESCALON AND SAN BENITO RESIDENTIAL AREAS. THERE IS NO GOING BACK. WE HAVE BROKEN THE DEFENSIVE LINES OF THE ENEMY. WE HAVE BROKEN (WORDS INDISTINCT) IN THE CAPITAL CITY, WE ARE FIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE DENS OF COLONEL PONCE AND OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAVE TURNED THE WAR INTO A BUSINESS. THOSE OFFICERS HAVE LUXURIOUS MANSIONS IN MIAMI. EVERY WEEKEND AND EVEN IN SPITE OF THE WAR, COL PONCE HAS ORGIES IN HIS LUXURIOUS HOMES IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR. SOLDIERS, PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WE CALL ON YOU TO JOIN THE PEOPLE AND JOIN OUR FRONT. PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WHO ARE LISTENING TO US, DO NOT ALLOW MORE BOMBINGS IN OUR CAPITAL CITY BY THE GENOCIDAL TANDONA GROUP (1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPT GEN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL). YOUNG OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS WHO ARE BEING KILLED IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WHY SHOULD YOU BE KILLED WHILE DEFENDING PONCE'S MANSIONS? THIS IS THE LAST SCENARIO OF THE LAST CHAPTER IN WHICH THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) WILL ACHIEVE THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE. WE CALL ON YOUR CONSCIENCE, YOUNG PATRIOTIC OFFICER. JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBINGS OF ZACAMIL. OVER 500 HOMES WERE RAZED. ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW THE HIGH COMMAND TO FINISH OFF THE CITY, TO FINISH OFF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE YOUR RELATIVES MIGHT BE? YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN ZACAMIL, MEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO. PATRIOTIC OFFICER, IT IS TIME WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR FATHERLAND, AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH LA TANDONA. PATRIOTIC OFFICERS WHO ARE LISTENING TO US: IT IS USELESS TO CONTINUE DEFENDING; TO CONTINUE DEFENDING WHAT, WE ASK YOU. THE FATHERLAND? WHAT FATHERLAND? THE FATHERLAND YOU ARE TOLD YOU ARE DEFENDING ARE THE MILLIONS AND THE MANSIONS OF COL PONCE AND OF COL ELENA FUENTES. PATRIOTIC OFFICERS: THE TIME IS HERE, TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD. WE HAVE MORE REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR: EARLY THIS MORNING, COMBAT HAS BEEN RESUMED IN THE FOLLOWING PLACES: ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND LA SULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS. THESE ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 AND THE CAVALRY. COMBATS ARE ALSO REPORTED NORTH OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE 4TH AND 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE. THERE ARE ALSO CLASHES IN THE AREA OF METROPOLIS AND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE BRACAMONTE BATTALION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN SAN BENITO AND LA SULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS, WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE, AND NOT FROM SAN SALVADOR. THE SOLDIERS ARE FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 OF SONSONATE. TROOPS FROM SONSONATE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO SAN SALVADOR, BECAUSE THE HIGH COMMAND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A MIXTURE OF SOLDIERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN THE CAPITAL CITY. THIS HAS YIELDED NEGATIVE RESULTS FOR THE HIGH COMMAND. IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES BETWEEN THE ATLACATL BATTALION AND THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS ATTACKED TROOPS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6. THESE ARE LITTLE SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE CAPITAL CITY, AND THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY. THEY ARE CLASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER. CLASHES ARE ALSO REPORTED WITH THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IS FIGHTING IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY? THE GARRISONS HAVE BEEN LEFT EMPTY. THE SAN FRANCISCO GOTERA GARRISON HAS BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ANYONE. THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IS BEING LEFT BY ITSELF, AS WELL AS THE MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 1. THE COLONELS ARE DESPERATE AND ARE BRINGING TROOPS INTO THE CAPITAL CITY. THIS IS A GOOD REPORT. THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 ARE IN THE CAPITAL. THIS IS THE SITUATION ON THIS MORNING OF VICTORIOUS BATTLES. WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT? THE SONSONATE SOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL CITY. THIS GIVES US A GENERAL PICTURE OF THE DEFEAT. IF THE SONSONATE TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN THE LAST DEFENSIVE LINE, THIS MEANS THAT THE SONSONATE LINES HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT. ATTENTION, FMLN ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS HAVE OPENED FIRE WITH THEIR M-60 MACHINEGUNS AGAINST UH-1H HELICOPTERS THAT ARE FLYING OVER THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF THE OLIGARCHY. LIKEWISE, A HELICOPTER IS RIGHT NOW FLYING OVER THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF OFFICES. FMLN UNITS ARE FIRING THEIR ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS IN THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA.",

IN FACT, AS THE NEWSPAPER SUGGESTS, THE YANKEE HAND IS TODAY IN EL SALVADOR AS IT WAS YESTERDAY IN VIETNAM. THE WOUNDED MOTHER WHO TRIES TO COMFORT HER DAUGHTER, A VICTIM OF THE BOMBINGS, IS NOT AN ISOLATED PICTURE. IT IS A SYMBOL OF THE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THAT COUNTRY. THE UNITED STATES IS NOT INNOCENT OF THESE CRIMES BECAUSE U.S. PILOTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE MASSACRE. IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT IS THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION DOING? IN FACT, HE IS DOING NOTHING THAT COULD NOT BE PREDICTED. PRESIDENT BUSH GETS ON THE PHONE AND CALLS HIS SALVADORAN CRONY ALFREDO CRISTINI TO ASSURE HIM THAT EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT, THAT HE CAN GO ON, THAT THE U.S. POSITION IS FAVORABLE TO HIS REGIME. THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RECENT BRUTAL KILLINGS OF UNION LEADERS BY THE ARMY. BUSH ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MASSACRE OF SPANISH PRIESTS. THE PRESIDENT ONLY PRAISES THE ARMY, THE AIR FORCE, THE POLICE AND PARAMILITARY EFFORTS TO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE. BUSH AND CRISTIANI COULD NOT FAIL TO MENTION THE TRITE SLOGAN OF THE CUBAN AND NICARAGUAN AID TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. NOR DID BUSH FAIL TO EXPRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S SOLIDARITY. BUT, SOLIDARITY WITH WHOM? ALL WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT UP TO NOW ARE THE PROTESTS PROVOKED IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE U.S. MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN REGIME. THE ONLY REALITIES ARE THE DEMONSTRATIONS STAGED FROM LOS ANGELES TO NEW YORK TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. AID. THE ONLY FACT IS THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION IS BEING PUBLICLY QUESTIONED ABOUT THIS AID. THE ONLY PICTURE THAT HAS BEEN DISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IS THAT OF A WOMAN WHO INTERRUPTS BUSH'S SPEECH TO SHOUT TO HIM: WHY ARE WE SENDING MONEY TO EL SALVADOR? WHY ARE WE KILLING PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR? IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO OVERLOOK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CURRENT SALVADORAN SITUATION. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST BE AWARE OF THIS REALITY AND MUST ACT ACCORDINGLY.",

IN THIS AGGRESSION THE FMLN DISPLAYED ITS WEAPONRY. IT DISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, WHICH....(CHANGES THOUGHT) BY THE WAY, IN RECENT DAYS THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEGUN A NUMBER OF SEARCHES IN SOME HOUSES WHERE IT IS BELIEVED THAT SOME OF THESE WEAPONS WERE LOCATED. WE HAVE ALREADY FOUND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS. IN ADDITION, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AND HID BEHIND YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. IT USED YOU AS A SHIELD, WANTING TO CONVEY THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT THE PEOPLE HERE WOULD RISE UP TO SUPPORT THEM. THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT THIS VIEW IS TOTALLY FALSE. FAR FROM SUPPORTING THE FMLN, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, SALVADORAN BROTHERS, SUPPORTED THE ARMED FORCES IN THE TREMENDOUS EFFORT IT HAS CONDUCTED TO REPEL THE FMLN AGGRESSION. HOWEVER, WE MUST NOW CONSIDER A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN AGGRESSION OF THIS SIZE WITHOUT SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ABROAD. ON THIS OCCASION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS SUPPORT CAME FROM NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA AND CUBAN PRESIDENT CASTRO, BUT CHIEFLY FROM ORTEGA WHO IS TRYING TO RAISE A SMOKESCREEN IN THE FACE OF THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT MRS VIOLETTA CHAMORRO MAY DEFEAT HIM IN THE ELECTIONS, AND BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PUPPET OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST AGGRESSION IN WHICH ORTEGA AND CASTRO PARTICIPATE. IF THIS IS NOT SO, LET US TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED. DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU WERE SUFFERING MOMENTS OF ANGUISH LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS WHO WERE SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS. WE HAVE ALSO MANAGED TO COLLECT EVIDENCE THAT THE ORTEGA GOVERNMENT TRAINED FMLN FIGHTERS IN THE USE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WEAPONRY, SPECIFICALLY THE GRENADE LAUNCHERS. WHAT HAPPENED? IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE BEGAN NOTICING WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED. IN THE FOILED ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE, A SUBSEQUENT ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, AND LASTLY, AN ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL GUARD GARRISON PARTICULAR KINDS OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED. AS A RESULT OF THE SAVAGE ACTION BY FMLN, TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE KILLED. MOREOVER, LET US RECALL AND SEE THE CONNECTION THAT EXISTS WITH ALL THE SHIPMENTS THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN STOPPING BETWEEN NICARAGUAN AND EL SALVADOR. ONE SHIPMENT WAS MADE PRIOR TO THE VISIT WE PRESIDENTS MADE TO COSTA RICA. IN THAT COUNTRY, WE DENOUNCED ORTEGA FOR CONTINUING TO SEND WEAPONS AND SUPPORTING THE FMLN IN AN OPEN VIOLATION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY? ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TWO LIGHT AIRPLANES COMING FROM NICARAGUA WERE DISCOVERED. THEIR FLIGHT COURSE INDICATES THAT THEY CAME FROM NICARAGUA, ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHERE THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND. AS ADDITIONAL PROOF, WE HAVE A DOCUMENT SHOWING THAT ONE LIGHT AIRCRAFT BELONGS TO THE SETA TRANSPORTATION COMPANY LOCATED IN NICARAGUA'S AUGUSTO CESAR SANDINO AIRPORT. IT WAS BRINGING SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR THE FMLN. IN THAT AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT, FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED: THE PILOT WHO WAS WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS; I MEAN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS LIKE THE ONES WORN IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND LIKE THE ONES THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCE USE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER PERSON KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD A WEAPON IN HIS HAND AND A BULLET WOUND IN FOREHEAD. HE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAW HIMSELF IMPLICATED IN THIS SITUATION. (CONTINUED)",

AS WE HAVE REPORTED, THE GENERAL STAFF RESPONDED WITH A 4-PRONGED DELAYED RESPONSE. THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED FROM FOUR ADVANCED POSITIONS, ONE HELD BY THE BRACAMONTE BATTALION, WHICH ADVANCED TOWARD ESCALON; IT WAS NEUTRALIZED BY OUR AMBUSHES. OUR UNITS ARE ENTRENCHED IN THE MANSIONS OF THE OLIGARCHS IN THAT SECTOR OF ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY AMBUSHED AND REPELLED ATTACKS FROM THE VANGUARD POSITIONS LAUNCHED BY THE ARMED FORCES. THE SECOND DIRECTION IN WHICH THE ENEMY RESPONDED TO OUR PRESENCE WAS DIRECTED ON THE SOUTHERN FREEWAY. THIS SECOND POSITION WAS AMBUSHED WITH RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND MACHINEGUN FIRE. THE THIRD ENEMY POSITION, WHICH WAS ADVANCING ON SANTA TECLA, WAS AMBUSHED AT LA UNIVERSAL POINT AND WAS ALSO NEUTRALIZED. THE ATLACATL BATTALION DEPLOYMENT ALONG GUADALUPE GARDENS WAS ALSO NEUTRALIZED. OUR BATTALIONS ARE STAGING SABOTAGE ACTIONS ON ELECTRICITY POSTS IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS. ALSO, WE HAVE A NEW REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT FMLN UNITS HAVE SET UP DOWNED ELECTRICITY POSTS AS BARRICADES ALONG THE SOUTH FREEWAY AND IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD. WE REPEAT, ALONG THE SOUTH FREEWAY AND IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, FMLN UNITS HAVE USED DOWNED ELECTRICITY POSTS AND VEHICLES AS BARRICADES. THIS IS THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR. THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL, OUR UNITS ARE MAINTAINING POSITIONS. THE TROOPS IN THE INTERIOR PART OF THE REPUBLIC IN THAT NORTHERN REGION REFUSE TO ADVANCE TOWARD OUR POSITIONS, WHILE OUR UNITS ARE EXTENDING ALONG THE NORTHWESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN REGION OF THE CAPITAL. OUR UNITS ARE EXTENDING AND MOVING FOWARD ALONG THESE ZONES. THE AIR FORCE HAS OPENED FIRE ON SOME OF OUR POSITIONS IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS. WE REITERATE THE CALL TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS TO ABANDON ALL THOSE ZONES IMMEDIATELY. THE AIR FORCE IS BEGINNING NEW AIR RAIDS ON FMLN POSITIONS IN THOSE REGIONS. THEREFORE, WE CALL ON THE INHABITANTS OF THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS TO LEAVE THOSE AREAS.",

THE IDENTITY OF THE CREWMEN IN THE NICARAGUAN PLANES THAT CRASHED IN EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST WEEKEND CARRYING SOVIET ARMS IS A STATE SECRET ACCEDED TO BY LA PRENSA THIS MORNING AFTER GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A HIGH-RANKING SOURCE IN THE SANDINIST ARMY. THE SOURCE DISCLOSED FURTHER DETAILS OF THE BUTTERFLY OPERATION. THE ARMY SOURCE, WHICH OF COURSE REQUESTED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE THAT CRASHED IN SAN MIGUEL BELONGS TO NICARAGUA AND THAT THE PLANE'S REGISTRATION IS YANKEE NOVEMBER BRAVO YANKEE KILO. THERE ARE NO REPORTS SO FAR AS TO WHETHER ANY RELATIVES HAVE CLAIMED THE BODIES OF THE FOUR MILITARY MEN WHO WERE REPORTEDLY KILLED WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED. THREE OF THE CREWMEN WERE KILLED INSTANTLY, WHILE THE FOURTH COMMITTED SUICIDE. A PICTURE OF A YOUNG CUBAN GIRL, DATED IN JULY, IS THE ONLY PUBLISHED CLUE AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE MEN, WHETHER NICARAGUANS, CUBANS, OR SALVADORANS, COMMISSIONED FOR THIS CLANDESTINE MISSION DIRECTED FROM NICARAGUA. OUR SOURCE SAID THAT YOUNG SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WERE TRAINED AT THE NATIONAL CIVILIAN FLIGHT SCHOOL OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THE TRAINING WAS SUPERVISED BY CAPTAIN ROBIN ROMERO, THE FLIGHT SCHOOL'S DIRECTOR. THE TRAINING WAS ALSO CONDUCTED AT PUNTA HUETE AND LOS BRASILES. MOST OF THE FLIGHTS WERE MADE AT NIGHT. THE STUDENT PILOTS USED OIL LAMPS AS LANDING LIGHTS. THE SOURCE SAID THE TRAINING FLIGHTS WERE CONDUCTED IN LIGHT SINGLE-ENGINE PLANES FROM SANDINO AIRPORT TO PUNTA HUETE OR LOS BRASILES. THE HEAD OF THIS OPERATION WAS COMMANDER CHRISTIAN PICHARDO. IN THE OPERATION ALSO PARTICIPATED TWO SALVADORAN GUERRILLA COMMANDERS WHOSE IDENTITIES ARE UNKNOWN. THE CESSNA 310 HAD BEEN LEASED BY THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK (BND), WHICH IN TURN HAD ACQUIRED THE PLANE FROM THE ZETA NATIONAL CHARTER SERVICE, AN AERONICA SUBSIDIARY. BND ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR MARCOS BLANDON GRAVY LEASED THE PLANE, ONE OF SEVERAL AIRCRAFT INTENDED TO BE SENT TO EL SALVADOR. ANOTHER SINGLE-ENGINE CESSNA, WITH REGISTRATION CHARLIE BRAVO PAPA, AND AN AERO COMMANDER, WERE ADDED TO THE INVENTORY. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, THE AERO COMMANDER WAS CONFISCATED FROM COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN PUERTO CABEZAS A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY SANDINIST AIR FORCE (FAS) PLANES. THE PLANES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION, HOWEVER, REMAINED UNEQUIPPED TO FLY TO EL SALVADOR UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. (CONTINUED)",

ACCORDING TO CHICA, THE FMLN LEADERS IN MANAGUA DECIDED TO LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE, TRUSTING THE UNTS LEADERS' REPORTS THAT CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT FOR AN INSURRECTION BECAUSE FEBE ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ' DEATH IN THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS (SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION) HAD IGNITED THE PEOPLE'S SPIRITS. THE PRISONER SAID THAT THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT A SUMMARY TRIAL IN THE STYLE OF COMMUNIST PARTIES AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE. NOW, HE SAID, TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HAVING DECEIVED THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS WHO ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE LED BY LIES, THE UNTS LEADERS ARE EXPECTED TO CALL NEWS CONFERENCES TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEIR STRUGGLE CONTINUES. MEANWHILE, A REPORT FROM ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, INDICATES THAT FMLN TERRORIST CRIMINALS, USING SAM-7 MISSILES, ATTACKED A SALVADORAN AIR FORCE 0-2 AIRPLANE WHICH WAS IN THE AREA DIRECTING SUPPORT NEAR PIEDRA GRANDE ABAJO IN THE JURISDICTION OF ZACATECOLUCA. NO DAMAGES OR CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED. ANOTHER FMLN MISSILE WAS FIRED FROM LAS PIEDRAS HILL, IN THE SAME AREA, AGAINST ANOTHER SALVADORAN AIR FORCE 0-2 AIRPLANE, BUT THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT DAMAGED. THE SOURCE SAYS THE MISSILE EXPLODED IN THE AIR OVER ZACATECOLUCA. THE AIR FORCE, TO WHICH EXPERIENCED PILOTS LEND THEIR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, IS ADMIRED BY THE PEOPLE, WHO ARE GRATEFUL TO THEIR ARMED FORCES.",

        "text": "MARCO ANTONIO GUEVARA, OF THE \"UP TO DATE\" NEWSCAST. (GUEVARA) HOW DO THE FIVE PRESIDENTS CONCEIVE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN? HOW DOES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CONCEIVE THIS HAPPENING? (CRISTIANI) I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL MEETING AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MEETINGS. TO EXPLAIN THIS BETTER, MARCO ANTONIO, WE MUST SAY WE WILL NOT FALL INTO WHAT HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST, THAT IS, THE FAMOUS SYMMETRY. ON THIS OCCASION, WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL WHEN WE SAID THAT WE WERE NOT WILLING TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING SACRIFICES AND OTHER THINGS FROM THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEM EXCLUSIVELY. WE DEMANDED UNIFORMITY, AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY CONFRONTING THE AGGRESSION OF AN IRREGULAR FORCE -- ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN CENTRAL AMERICA -- ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED IN A UNIFORM MANNER, AS FAR AS MEASURES AND CRITERIA THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETINGS. THAT IS WHY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE SEEING HOW THE MEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE -- THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED MOST OF THE ATTENTION UP TO NOW -- ARE ALSO BEING ADOPTED FOR THE FMLN. WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO CLAIM IT IS THE ONLY TARGET OF AN AGGRESSION BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED FORCE SUPPORTED FROM ABROAD. HERE IN EL SALVADOR WE NOW HAVE GREATER EVIDENCE FOLLOWING THIS 11 NOVEMBER TERRORIST AGGRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS A MOVEMENT THAT CAN SURVIVE ONLY WITH SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, AND THAT IT OBEYS AND EXISTS BECAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENTS. IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT ONLY HAS THE CAPACITY TO GENERATE TERRORISM, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS DOCUMENT. WE CANNOT CONTINUE JUST TALKING ABOUT DEMOBILIZATION AND PACIFICATION IN NICARAGUA. IT IS TIME TO APPLY THIS TO ALL IRREGULAR GROUPS, BE IT THE URNG (GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY) IN GUATEMALA, OR ANY OTHER IRREGULAR ARMED GROUP THAT MAY COME UP AND MAY TRY TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE AREA. WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE DEEP INTO THE MINDS OF ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, AND FROM NOW ON, WE WILL HAVE GREATER UNIFORMITY IN TREATING ALL OF THOSE IRREGULAR GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN THE REGION. (MODERATOR) RENE HURTADO OF EL MUNDO. (HURTADO) MR PRESIDENT, FOLLOWING THE TELA AND COSTA DEL SOL MEETINGS, NICARAGUA HAS CHANGED ITS STAND. IN COSTA RICA, PRESIDENT ORTEGA WAS ASKED IF HE HAD SOLD OUT THE FMLN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE SUMMIT IN FAVOR OF NICARAGUA. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS, AND ALSO HOW YOU INTERPRET THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT ORTEGA HAS ACCEPTED SOME ISSUES ABOUT THE FMLN THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW IN TELA OR COSTA DEL SOL? ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN BE THE RESULT OF A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS LATER ON? (CRISTIANI) IN THE FIRST PLACE, I BELIEVE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA WAS UNABLE TO PULL ANY MORE TRICKS OUT OF HIS HAT, AND HE WAS FACING A FACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMED REVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN THE REGION. ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORING THE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE COMMITMENTS. ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE DEFENSE. THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT THE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF TOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. THIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.",

THE MAIN REASON IS THE VERY COMPLICATED PREDICAMENT IN WHICH OUR OFFENSIVE HAS PLACED CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND. AS YOU WILL REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MET WITH MUCH INTERNATIONAL DISREPUTE AND ISOLATION BECAUSE OF THE BRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES. ON THAT OCCASION, EL SALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE 96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR. WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THE DICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION. THIS WAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS. TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI? THE NORTH AMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THE GENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT IN SPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED. THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALL KNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESE COUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS. THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OF INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION. UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE? WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF GUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING. THE SUBJECT OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO. THIS DOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. JOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS, WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING. THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA -- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING -- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME. THE FMLN WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND IN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS ACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT. IT WAS NOT EASY. THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI PREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE HONDURAN PRESIDENT. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDAL REGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THE BULL BY THE HORNS. LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS. (CONTINUED)",

HERE IS THE SECOND PART OF THE NEWS CONFERENCE FEATURING DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ. (BEGIN RECORDING) (MAZA) THE DAS HAS EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL MASTERMINDED TWO ATTACKS INCLUDING THE THE MOST RECENT AND WORST ONE IN WHICH MORE THAN 60 INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE KILLED. (REPORTER) HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA MASTERMINDED THE RECENT ATTACK ON DAS? (MAZA) BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE CONDUCTED ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL POLICE EVER SINCE THE ATTACK OCCURRED POINT IN THAT DIRECTION. IF WE COMPARE THE MODUS OPERANDI OF RODRIGUEZ AND HIS PEOPLE, WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE (WORD INDISTINCT) AND THE ACTION ITSELF ARE VERY SIMILAR. FURTHERMORE, THIS MAN WAS IN THERE CELEBRATING THE GENOCIDE THAT HE HAD COMMITTED IN BOGOTA. (REPORTER) (QUESTION INDISTINCT) (MAZA) BECAUSE THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE THIS, AND ACCORDING TO CERTAIN STATEMENTS WE HAVE, HE WAS OVERJOYED BY THE DAMAGE THAT HE HAD CAUSED IN THE CITY GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED; SEEING HIM SUNBATHING AND SWIMMING ON THE ATLANTIC COAST LED US TO BELIEVE THIS. (REPORTER) IS THIS A POLICE REACTION TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS' ATTACK ON DAS? (MAZA) NO, I AM NOT SAYING THAT IT IS A REACTION. THIS IS THE RESULT OF VERY PROFESSIONAL WORK ON THE PART OF THE NATIONAL POLICE. THAT IS WHAT I TOLD THE PRESIDENT TODAY. I BRIEFED HIM ON THE EVENTS WHICH LED TO THE ACTION THAT HAS CHANGED THE SITUATION WHICH HAD PREVAILED IN THE COUNTRY JUST A FEW HOURS AGO. (END RECORDING)",

DINIZ WAS RELEASED AFTER BEING HELD FOR 6 DAYS BY FIVE CHILEANS, TWO CANADIANS, TWO ARGENTINES, AND ONE BRAZILIAN. THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THE CHILEANS CLAIMED TO BELONG TO THE EXTREMIST MIR (MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT) GROUP, BUT THIS ASSERTION HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED. ERRAZURIZ SAID THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS BEEN IN PERMANENT CONTACT WITH CHILEAN AMBASSADOR TO BRAZIL RAUL SCHMIDT IN KEEPING TRACK OF THE CASE.

        "text": "GOOD EVENING. I HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE TO READ A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE: (WORDS INDISTINCT) TODAY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TOLD LUIS SANDIGA CABRERA, OUR CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN PANAMA, THAT HE MUST LEAVE PANAMA IN 72 HOURS. 2. WE HAVE EXPRESSED TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE PANAMANIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN LIMA, OUR SURPRISE AND STRONG PROTEST OVER THAT DECISION. 3. IN VIEW OF THIS DECISION, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO REDUCE THE PERSONNEL OF ITS DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA AND TO MAINTAIN ITS RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY AT THE FIRST SECRETARY LEVEL. PERU WILL IN THIS WAY CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION OF PROTECTING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM IN ITS EMBASSY IN PANAMA WHILE THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ISSUES THE SAFE-CONDUCTS THAT WE REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS ON 28 MARCH 1954. PERU IS CONTACTING THE MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT (GROUP OF EIGHT) TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND TO ASK FOR SOLIDARITY AND COOPERATION IN OVERCOMING THIS MOMENTARY CRISIS. THE DELICATE SITUATION REGARDING THE PEOPLE AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY HAS PROVOKED OUR JUSTIFIED ALARM AND IMPELLED US TO BEGIN TALKS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM WILL BE RESPECTED. WE HAVE TALKED WITH THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT. I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITH THE AMBASSADORS OF VENEZUELA, MEXICO, AND COLOMBIA. I AM NOW READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS: (REPORTER) MR LARCO COX, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA ARE NOT EXACTLY POLITICAL REFUGEES BUT COMMON CRIMINALS. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS? (LARCO COX) THE COUNTRY THAT GRANTS ASYLUM DETERMINES THIS. WE HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO REVIEW EACH ONE OF THEM AND THEIR FILES. WE HAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM WERE FACING ANY TRIALS IN PANAMA OR THE UNITED STATES. OUR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT NONE OF THEM ARE FACING ANY TRIALS. THE CHARGES WERE MADE AFTERWARD. WE SEE THIS AS A RESULT OF THE EMOTIONAL CLIMATE PRESENTLY EXISTING IN PANAMA. (REPORTER) WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OF THE INCIDENT? (LARCO COX) IT IS THE DIPLOMATIC WAY TO EXPRESS A PROTEST OVER WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE. ACCORDING TO PANAMANIAN REPORTS, CHARGE D'AFFAIRES LUIS SANDIGA HAS MADE STATEMENTS ON THE SITUATION THAT DID NOT PLEASE THE GOVERNMENT. THE TRUTH IS THAT SANDIGA HAS NOT MADE ANY DECLARATIONS. HOWEVER, FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS IN PANAMA AND HE HAS EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE IS SEEKING RETALIATION AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT. HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN TO POINT AT SANDIGA AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLEGED STATEMENTS. SANDIGA HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SITUATION BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HIS JOB. BESIDES, HIS CAR AND THE CAR BELONGING TO ONE OF THE EMBASSY'S MILITARY ATTACHES HAVE BEEN STOLEN; THERE IS NO WAY TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION. (REPORTER) ARE YOU SAYING THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SITUATION? (LARCO COX) YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS. (REPORTER) IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES, WILL PERU RECALL ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL FROM PANAMA? (LARCO COX) WE CANNOT GO TO THAT EXTREME BECAUSE WE ARE FULFILLING A HUMANITARIAN CAUSE, AS WE SAID IN THE COMMUNIQUE. OUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME IS TO SEE THAT THE RIGHT OF ASYLUM IS RESPECTED. AS LONG AS THE REFUGEES REMAIN IN THE EMBASSY, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR REPRESENTATION AT THE LEVEL OF FIRST SECRETARY. (END RECORDING)",

WE HAVE VIEWED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION PROCESS AS A MEDIATOR. THIS ATTITUDE IS AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCESS THAT COULD FACILITATE THE NEGOTIATION EFFORT. ON OUR PART, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS MEDIATION AND WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT. 2. THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI, THE DOUBTFUL AND INSUFFICIENT INITIAL RESULTS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ABSENCE OF CONDITIONS FOR THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION, THE CONTINUATION OF THE PERSECUTION OF CHURCHES, AND THE LACK OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH THROUGH THE DIRECT OR COVERT GAGGING OF THE PRESS SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT IS CARRYING OUT A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH ALL THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES. FOR THIS REASON, THE TERMS OF THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION MUST BE REORIENTED SO THAT IT WILL BE TURNED INTO A NATIONAL PROCESS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THOSE FORCES. 3. WE VIEW AS GRAVELY ERRONEOUS THE PERSISTENCE OF A GOVERNMENT POLICY BASED ON THE IDEA OF THE FMLN'S ALLEGED MILITARY WEAKNESS. THIS POSITION, SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WAS PUT FORTH PRIOR TO 11 NOVEMBER (DATE OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FMLN MILITARY OFFENSIVE) WILL ONLY LEAD THE COUNTRY TO GREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION. 4. WE REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO HOLD THE MEETING OF BOTH SIDES WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL SOON. WE HOPE THAT MR CRISTIANI'S VISIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS WILL LEAD TO SUCH A MEETING AND THAT WE CAN AGREE WITH THE MEDIATOR ON THE DATE TO HOLD IT. 5. WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTED AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND A POLITICAL SOLUTION. THE SENDING OF SIGNALS TO ONE OR ANOTHER SECTOR OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ARMY, USING THE PRESSURE OF SETTING CONDITIONS OR THREATENING THE END OF AID, DOES NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE BELIEVE THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS CAN MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO END THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY BY AGREEING TO SUSPEND THAT AID, SOMETHING WHICH COULD FORM PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL A CEASE-FIRE.

        "text": "SMARTLY DRESSED AND SPEAKING IN NEARLY PERFECT ENGLISH, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS AGAIN VISITED THE UNITED STATES, WHERE HE TRIED TO APPEAR AT THE CONGRESS AND THE UNITED NATIONS AS A STATESMAN AWARE OF HIS RIGHTS. THIS IS, HOWEVER, A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, AND HE KNOWS IT. BUT THIS POINT WAS ALSO STRESSED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO BOOED HIM AT NEARLY EVERY LARGE U.S. CITY HE VISITED. ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIM ALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA (NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE) REPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEW TO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE AND CHECK THE ARMY'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS. WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAG HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE WASHINGTON'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT. ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HIS PREDECESSOR. HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THE RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELY EIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS. WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS. MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TO SUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THE GUERRILLAS. THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS. THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICH EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THE GOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THE EYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES. THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY. IF SERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED. THIS COULD EVEN GIVE THE UNITED STATES A PRETEXT TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO AID EL SALVADOR, A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING WHAT USE HAS BEEN NEARLY $4 BILLION DELIVERED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN 10 YEARS OF WAR. IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR OR RESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUST ENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED. THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO INFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEING THE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HIS PARTY. THESE POINTS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH IN A COUNTRY IMMERSED IN WAR. IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAK, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS EVEN WEAKER. ANYWAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO INCREASE AID FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. THIS CONTRIBUTES TO PUTTING FAR INTO THE DISTANCE ANY PLANS TO END THE WAR.",

THIS PAST JANUARY, THE 29-YEAR-OLD GALEANO BECAME THE LEADER OF ABOUT 12,000 NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST REBELS BASED IN HONDURAS WHEN THE POST OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE RN ARMY, A POST ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ HAD HELD FOR 10 YEARS, WAS ELIMINATED. NICARAGUA WILL HOLD ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY, AND THE MAIN CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ARE DANIEL ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FSLN) AND VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO OF THE UNO. THE REBELS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE URGED NICARAGUANS TO VOTE FOR THE UNO CANDIDATE. \"IF THE UNO WINS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT TO SEE IF ON 25 APRIL THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSFER OF POWER AND PROFOUND REFORMS, AND PARTICULARLY TO SEE IF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM DISAPPEARS,\" GALEANO SAID. \"IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR STEAL THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A SOCIAL DISRUPTION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND THE HARDEST STRUGGLE OF RECENT YEARS WILL TAKE PLACE,\" HE ADDED. THE CONTRA MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT \"IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT A SANDINIST VICTORY, \"WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE FIGHTING.\" HE ASSURED THAT THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOT ACCEPT AN FSLN VICTORY IN THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS. GALEANO ADDED THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 30,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHERN NICARAGUAN DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO \"INTIMIDATE AND MURDER\" UNO FOLLOWERS AND TO PREVENT APPROXIMATELY 300,000 NICARAGUANS FROM VOTING. GALEANO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS AND THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS OF THE ELECTIONS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE AREAS WHERE THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS HAVE DEPLOYED. \"EVEN THOUGH THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS CLAIM THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS FREELY HELD, THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES,\" HE SAID. GALEANO SAID THAT ABOUT 5,000 OF HIS MEN ARE INSIDE NICARAGUA, AND BETWEEN 10,000 TO 12,000 MEN ARE IN BASES IN HONDURAS, \"NOT MOVING, BUT JUST OBSERVING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS\" IN NICARAGUA. THE REBELS IN HONDURAS ARE RECEIVING U.S. HUMANITARIAN AID IN EL PARAISO DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REJECTED A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN APPROVED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. THE REBELS CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY GUARANTEES FOR THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. \"THE DEMOBILIZATION IS BASED ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CREATING CONDITIONS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED RN TO JOIN CIVIC LIFE,\" HE ADDED. GALEANO SAID THAT THE DISMANTLING OF HIS FORCES DOES NOT \"DEPEND OF A SIMPLE ELECTIONS,\" BUT RATHER ON \"THE SANDINISTS LEAVING POWER COMPLETELY.\" THE CONTRA LEADER WARNED THAT \"WE CANNOT LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS WHEN THE CAUSES THAT LED TO OUR TAKING UP ARMS HAVE NOT DISAPPEARED. THERE STILL IS REPRESSION, A LACK OF FREEDOM, AND ALL OF THIS WAS GENERATED BY THE SANDINISTS.\" HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE EVENT THE UNO SHOULD WIN THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS, \"WE WOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT A MUTUAL DEMOBILIZATION. THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITH AN INTER-AMERICAN PEACE FORCE THAT WILL RECEIVE ALL THE WEAPONRY AND SOVIET TANKS OF THE SANDINISTS. THEN, WHEN WE ARE AT AN EVEN LEVEL OF FORCES, WE WILL TURN OVER OUR OWN WEAPONS.\" THE CONTRA CHIEF SUGGESTED A NATIONAL POLICE BE CREATED IN NICARAGUA. FRANKLIN SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE PEACE TALKS, BUT PERHAPS AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT. HE ASSURED THAT THE REBEL FORCES WILL NOT CARRY OUT \"ANY OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER THE ELECTIONS, AND WILL WAIT AND SEE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN NICARAGUA.\" HE SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPS IN YAMALES IF REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS. \"IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS DO NOT ALLOW US TO REMAIN, WE WILL LEAVE (FOR NICARAGUA), BUT OUR REFUGEEES WILL STAY, AS REFUGEES,\" HE ADDED. THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CONTRAS SAID THAT HIS FORCES WILL NOT ATTACK THE UN PEACE OBSERVERS IN THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER AREA. HE SAID THAT RN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ARE NORMAL, BUT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE OUSTING OF BERMUDEZ, ARGUING THAT THIS IS A FAIT ACCOMPLI.",

THE GUERRILLA ACTIONS BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 22 FEBRUARY WHEN A LARGE COLUMN OF THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) ENTERED TURBO MUNICIPALITY, NORTHEAST OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, AND SABOTAGED THE POWER SYSTEM LEAVING THE ENTIRE AREA WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. NATIONAL ARMY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT ONE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER AND SIX SOLDIERS WERE KILLED, FOUR WERE WOUNDED, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KIDNAPPED DURING THE ATTACKS AGAINST MILITARY BASES AND POLICE INSTALLATIONS IN SEGOVIA BY THE 4TH FRONT OF THE FARC (REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA). MEANWHILE IN BOGOTA, MILITARY FORCES COMMANDER NELSON MEJIA HENAO DENIED THAT COLOMBIA IS IN GUERRILLA HANDS AND REAFFIRMED THE TROOPS' UNYIELDING DETERMINATION TO DEFEND NATIONAL ORDER AND DEMOCRACY. THE HIGHEST-RANKING OFFICER, WHO EXPRESSED REGRET OVER THE DEATHS OF THE SOLDIERS IN SEGOVIA, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT IS NORMAL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE WAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WAGING AGAINST ARMED SUBVERSION. LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, AFTER THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE 25TH AGRARIAN CONGRESS OF THE (FAC) (EXPANSION UNKNOWN), SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE DESPERATE AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THEIR ACTIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THE ARMED FORCES WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT SUBVERSION ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED. THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION AT THE RELEASE OF SANTANDER DEPARTMENT SENATOR JORGE SERRANO GONZALEZ, WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAT COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY HAS AT THIS MOMENT. HE ADDED FINALLY: I HOPE THAT IS HE ALREADY AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY.",

WE BELIEVE IT CONSTITUTES THE MOST EXPEDIENT WAY TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE COUNTRY, AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ALONG THAT PATH. (MODERATOR) AIDA MONTALVO. (MONTALVO) IN REGARD TO THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE FOREIGN DEBT, WHEN ARE YOU PLANNING TO GO TO MEXICO, AND HOW WILL THE SALVADORAN DEBT WITH THAT COUNTRY BE RENEGOTIATED? (CRISTIANI) THE TIMETABLE FOR THE TRIP IS STILL UNDECIDED. THERE IS NOT DEFINITE DATE. I THINK IT MAY TAKE PLACE IN APRIL OR MAY OF THIS YEAR. OUR FIRST SCHEDULED VISIT WILL BE TO VENEZUELA. (MODERATOR) CARLOS MARIO MARQUEZ OF AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE. (MARQUEZ) (WORDS INDISTINCT) SOCIAL ASPECTS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THAT, SINCE SOME SUPPORT HAVING PRIMARY MEETINGS AND THEN A SUMMIT, SO TO SPEAK? (CRISTIANI) I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM. WE SAID THAT THE RESUMPTION OF THE TALKS MUST TAKE PLACE WHEN THE FMLN ENTERS THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH A SERIOUS ATTITUDE. WE MAINTAIN OUR STANCE THAT THEY MUST STOP ALL VIOLENCE THAT IS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AFFECTING CIVILIANS, THAT IS, ALL THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THE FMLN CONDUCTS. THIS IS A SMALL REQUEST THAT OBTAINED THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AT THE SAN ISIDRO CORONADO MEETING IN COSTA RICA. I THINK THAT THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE ASKED FOR CHANGES IN FORMAT, AND WE SAID WE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH MOST OF THE REQUESTS WE HAVE RECEIVED. WE ARE NOW WAITING FOR THE FMLN, SINCE THEY ASKED FOR TIME TO ANALYZE THINGS A LITTLE BEFORE HAVING THE MEETING. WE ARE AWAITING THE VISIT OF MR. DE SOTO IN EARLY MARCH. OBVIOUSLY, THE DIALOGUE HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES, (WORDS INDISTINCT). I THINK THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO AGREE TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIONS, AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS NO DIALOGUE NOW. (MODERATOR) EPIGMENIO IBARRA. (IBARRA) MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY IN NICARAGUA, DANIEL ORTEGA SAID AT A RALLY THAT HE WILL WAGE A CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION. HE SAID THAT THE REVOLUTION DID NOT DIE WITH THE ELECTIONS. HE SAID THAT THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FSLN) WILL RULE FROM BELOW. WE SENSE A PRETTY COMPLEX CLIMATE FOR THE TRANSITION IN NICARAGUA. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT DANIEL ORTEGA'S STATEMENTS? HOW DO YOU VIEW THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE A TRUE TRANSITION FROM POWER TO POWER INSTEAD OF A TRANSITION OF GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA? (CRISTIANI) AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, STATEMENTS BY ORTEGA AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SANDINIST FRONT ARE A SOURCE OF CONCERN. THEY COULD INDICATE THAT THE ELECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FREE AND HONEST, BUT ALSO A FARCE AS FAR AS IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS CONCERNED. THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO FREELY PICK THEIR RULERS AND THE RIGHT OF THESE RULERS TO ACT AS THEY DEEM BEST. I WOULD SAY THAT THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION BELONGS NOT JUST TO THE FSLN. THE FSLN WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVOLUTION IN NICARAGUA AGAINST ANASTASIO SOMOZA. THE FACT IS THAT A CONSENSUS EXISTED AMONG ALL SECTORS THAT SUPPORTED THAT REVOLUTION. THE FSLN HAS NO MONOPOLY ON OR EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THAT REVOLUTION. I BELIEVE THAT IN IDEOLOGICAL TERMS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VIEWS OF MS. CHAMORRO AND UNO (NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION), THAT IS, THE NEW GOVERNMENT-ELECT, AND THE VIEWS OF THE FSLN. YET, THE PEOPLE PICKED THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS WORRISOME TO HEAR SOME STATEMENTS THAT THE FSLN WILL RULE FROM BELOW. WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD SEEK TO DO THAT BY KEEPING CONTROL OVER THE ARMY. LET ME REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING DEMOCRATIC ABOUT A POLITICAL PARTY CONTROLLING THE ARMY. THE ARMY MUST RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, AND NOT TO JUST ONE POLITICAL PARTY. WE BELIEVE THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED YET. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY THINGS LEFT PENDING. (CONTINUED)",

ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS, THIS CLARIFICATION CAME IN REPLY TO STATEMENTS MADE BY CEREZO THAT THE U.S. POSITION IN THIS REGARD DIFFERS FROM THAT OF MOST COUNTRIES WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: (BEGIN RECORDING) (CEREZO) ALL THESE ACTIONS (WORDS INDISTINCT) THE UNITED STATES POINTING THE FINGER TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES ARE AIMED AT (WORD INDISTINCT) IN GENEVA, BECAUSE I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT WHAT IT WANTS AT THIS TIME IS TO HAVE GUATEMALA CONDEMNED AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TARNISH OUR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, BECAUSE THE SUCCESS OF THE ESQUIPULAS II PLAN GAVE GUATEMALA, AS AN AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT COUNTRY, A LOT OF ROOM FOR ACTION. THAT IS WHAT IT WANTS TO DO, BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOOD FOR LARGE COUNTRIES TO SEE COUNTRIES LIKE GUATEMALA, WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE, ACHIEVE HISTORIC SUCCESSES BY SHOWING THAT OUR COUNTRY IS RIGHT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CERTAIN U.S. GROUPS. THEY NOW WANT (WORDS INDISTINCT). MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THEY NOW SORT OF WANT TO GET BACK AT US FOR THE ESQUIPULAS II PLAN. (END RECORDING) IN REPLY TO THESE STATEMENTS BY PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE U.S. EMBASSY POINTED OUT IN ITS COMMUNIQUE OF 6 MARCH THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD SUPPORTED THE ESQUIPULAS II PEACE PROCESS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. IT ADDED THAT EVER SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS ACCORD, GUATEMALA HAS RECEIVED $600 MILLION IN U.S. AID. THIS SHOWS, ACCORDING TO THE EMBASSY, THAT U.S. SUPPORT FOR GUATEMALAN DEMOCRACY CONTINUED TO BE STRONG AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENT. IN ANY CASE, FROM PRESIDENT CEREZO'S PERSPECTIVE THE U.S. ATTITUDE IN THIS SITUATION REFLECTS THE TRADITIONAL INCLINATION OF THAT COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT HISTORY TO DICTATE RULES TO OTHER NATIONS REGARDING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. CEREZO COMPARED GUATEMALA'S SITUATION IN MATTERS OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO THE SITUATION IN SEVERAL U.S. CITIES WHERE THE POLICE ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL CRIME. AS AN EXAMPLE, HE CITED WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE ASSAULTS, MURDERS, AND CRIMES FREQUENTLY RELATED TO DRUG CONSUMPTION HAVE REACHED VERY ASTONISHING LEVELS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. AS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF AMBASSADOR STROOK, CEREZO SAID THAT THE DIPLOMAT HAS NOT BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM GUATEMALA, BUT RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES FOR CONSULTATIONS BY ORDER OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT. IN STATEMENTS MADE MINUTES AFTER RECEIVING THE CREDENTIALS OF THE NEW FRG AMBASSADOR, HOWEVER, CEREZO SAID THAT HIS RETURN WAS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, DUE TO A DECISION WE MADE.",

ACCORDING TO WITNESSES' REPORTS, TWO 23 TO 25-YEAR-OLD INDIVIDUALS WALKED TO GEN. LEIGH'S OFFICE, ON THE FOURTH FLOOR OF THE BUILDING LOCATED AT 95 LUIS TALLE OJEDA STREET. (PASSAGE OMITTED) WITNESSES SAID THEY HEARD TWO BURSTS OF GUNFIRE: ONE BURST OF THREE SHOTS LASTING THREE SECONDS AND ANOTHER BURST OF SEVEN TO EIGHT SHOTS LASTING LONGER. GEN. LEIGH'S SECRETARY, JOANNA SANTIS RETAMAL, CAME TO A WINDOW TO REPORT THE INCIDENT. OTHER REPORTS SAID THAT THE TWO INDIVIDUALS BROKE INTO THE OFFICES AND ENTERED GEN. LEIGH'S PRIVATE OFFICE. (PASSAGE OMITTED) THE INDIVIDUALS USED 9 MM SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOLS. ACCORDING TO THE EXPERTS, GEN. RUIZ WAS HIT THREE TIMES AND GEN GUSTAVO LEIGH WAS HIT FIVE TIMES. THE BULLETS HIT GEN. LEIGH IN HIS EYE, NOSE, RIGHT ARM, RIGHT LEG, AND STOMACH. THE TWO ATTACKERS THEN WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS AND ESCAPED TOWARD PROVIDENCIA.

THESE ATTITUDES AND ACTS DO NOT HELP IN THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO REUNITE ALL CHILEANS. (END RECORDING) KRAUSS SAID IT WAS A REGRETTABLE INCIDENT BECAUSE IT HURT THE SPIRIT AND PURPOSE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION'S WORK. THE ATTACK AGAINST LEIGH WOULD MAKE A GOOD PATHOLOGICAL STUDY, THE MINISTER ADDED. (PASSAGE OMITTED) THE NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS HAS SAID THE ATTACK ON GUSTAVO LEIGH DOES NOT REFLECT THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER JORGE MARTINEZ, MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (MIR) LEADER CARLOS RUIG, AND MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR) LEADER FRANCISCO ESCOBAR HEARD THE NEWS WHILE HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE PRISON HOUSE. THE FPMR'S FRANCISCO ESCOBAR SAID HE IS SURE HIS ORGANIZATION WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT BECAUSE, AS HE SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING WITH IT. (PASSAGE OMITTED) MIR REPRESENTATIVE CARLOS RUIG SAID THAT THE MIR WOULD NOT CARRY OUT ANY ARMED ACTION AT THIS TIME, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LEVEL OF GEN. LEIGH'S INVOLVEMENT IN PAST REPRESSIONS. COMMUNIST LEADER JORGE MARTINEZ SAID THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO RESPECTING THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION.

LINARES ASSERTED WHEN REFERRING TO FORMER COLLABORATORS OF FORMER GENERAL NORIEGA WHO SOUGHT SHELTER IN THESE EMBASSIES SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. THE MEXICAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS GRANTED DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM TO RAFAEL AROSEMENA, FORMER MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF PANAMA. HOWEVER, THE PANAMANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT GRANT HIM A SAFECONDUCT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, AND THEY SENT A NOTE TO THE MEXICAN EMBASSY URGING IT TO DESIST FROM OFFERING HIM PROTECTION. ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, RAFAEL AROSEMENA IS INVOLVED IN AUTHORIZING THE PAYMENT OF CHECKS FOR $12 MILLION, MADE OUT TO CASH BY FORMER COLONEL MARCOS JUSTINES. MEANWHILE, HERACLIDES SUCRE AND GONZALO GONZALEZ, FORMER MAJORS IN THE NOW DEFUNCT DEFENSE FORCES, HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY. THEY ARE ACCUSED OF KILLING MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI, WHO LED THE FOILED COUP D'ETAT AGAINST NORIEGA IN OCTOBER 1989. \"WE ARE WILLING TO PAY WHATEVER PRICE IS NECESSARY TO ENFORCE THE LAW, BECAUSE THESE POLITICAL REFUGEES ARE COMMON CRIMINALS AND THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO THAT BENEFIT,\" LINARES STATED WHEN ASKED BY CRITICA LIBRE IF PANAMA WOULD BE WILLING TO STOP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM AT THE MEXICAN AND PERUVIAN EMBASSIES FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FACING A TRIAL FOR THE CRIMES THEY REPORTEDLY PERPETRATED DURING THE PREVIOUS REGIME. LINARES SAID THAT PANAMA WILL MAINTAIN ITS POSITION OF NOT GRANTING SAFE-CONDUCTS TO THESE REFUGEES, EVEN IF THE MEXICAN AND PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT INSIST ON GRANTING THEM DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM, AND ADMITTED THAT THIS WILL LIKELY CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT. NEVERTHELESS, LINARES SAID THAT HE HOPES THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH EITHER OF THESE COUNTRIES, WHICH INSIST ON KEEPING FORMER COLLABORATORS OF FORMER GEN NORIEGA AS REFUGEES, AND HE EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THESE NATIONS. \"WE HOPE THAT RELATIONS WITH MEXICO WILL NOT COOL OFF OR REACH A BREAKING POINT GIVEN THE AFFECTION THAT UNITES US AS FREE NATIONS,\" LINARES ADDED. HE REVEALED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY SENT A NOTE TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT STATING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE DIPLOMATI PROTECTION TO THE REFUGEES IN ITS EMBASSY, BECAUSE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE STARTED AGAINST THEM AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE DIPLOMATIC MISSION. \"WE ARE PREPARING A NOTE OF REPLY TO THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT,\" FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES SAID. THE FOLLOWING PERSONS ARE STILL REFUGEES AT THE ECUADORAN EMBASSY: FORMER PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER RENE BULTRON, FORMER LABOR MINISTER CESAR MARTANS, FORMER NATIONAL MORTGAGE BANK MANAGER JULIO SHAIK, FORMER IRHE (INSTITUTE OF HYDRAULIC RESOURCES AND ELECTRIFICATION) DIRECTOR LEOVIGILDO HERRRERA, AND FORMER TOURISM DIRECTOR BERNARDO DOMINGUEZ. LAST WEEK THE FOREIGN MINISTER REVIEWED THE POSSIBILITY OF GRANTING SAFE-CONDUCTS TO FIVE OF THESE FORMER OFFICIALS IN THE PREVIOUS REGIME, PROVIDED THERE IS NO CASE PENDING AGAINST THEM. ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL, THESE REFUGEES FACE CHARGES FOR PLOTTING AGAINST THE STATE'S SECURITY, A POLITICAL CRIME.

        "text": "GOOD EVENING, A COMMUNIQUE HAS JUST BEEN ISSUED AT THE NATIONAL CAPITOL. THE COMMUNIQUE HAS BEEN SIGNED BY ALL THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES OF THE COUNTRY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LIBERAL PARTY. THE COMMUNIQUE ASKS THE GOVERNMENT TO OFFER FULL GUARANTEES DURING THE ELECTIONS PROCESS AND TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS. THE FOLLOWING IS THE COMMUNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED IN THE ELIPTICO ROOM OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL: (BEGIN RECORDING) (UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER) WE REPORT TO THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING: 1. WE ONCE AGAIN CONDEMN THE VILE MURDER OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DR. BERNARDO JARAMILLO. THIS MURDER HAS MADE EVIDENT THE LACK OF GUARANTEES IN THE COUNTRY, GUARANTEES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES. WE REJECT THE MANIPULATIONS IN WHICH OFFICIAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENGAGED IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTIGATING THIS CRIME. 2. WE DENOUNCE THAT THE OFFICIAL APPARATUS IS AT THE SERVICE OF ONLY ONE CANDIDATE AND THAT IT IS PREPARED TO ESTABLISH PARTY PREDOMINANCE THAT WOULD IN PRACTICE BE A REJECTION OF DEMOCRATIC PLURALISM. 3. WE DEMAND FULL GUARANTEES FOR ALL THE FORCES PARTICIPATING IN THE ELECTIONS AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE STATE MEDIA SO THAT THESE FORCES CAN MAKE KNOWN THEIR POLITICAL POSITIONS. 4. WE REQUEST GUARANTEES THAT THE NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME DIFFICULTIES THAT EXISTED DURING THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE STILL UNKNOWN. 5. UNDER THE CURRENT CONDITIONS, WE ASK OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL TO ABSTAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS OF THAT COUNCIL. 6. IN VIEW OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE AGREED TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND OUR ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND DEMAND A POSTPONEMENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY. 7. WE INSIST THAT THE RATIFICATION OF CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS IN THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRY REPRESENTS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION TO FINDING AN INSTITUTIONAL INTERLOCUTOR IN NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 8. WE ANNOUNCE THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL (WORDS INDISTINCT) TO VERIFY THAT THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES WE ARE DEMANDING ARE GRANTED AND TO OBSERVE THE ELECTIONS PROCESS. 9. THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION HEREBY STATES ITS DECISION TO WORK FOR THE FORMATION OF A CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THAT MUST HAVE A DEMOCRATIC AND PLURALISTIC COMPOSITION WITH THE DECIDING PARTICIPATION OF THE NATIONAL (WORD INDISTINCT) TO APPROVE A NEW CONSTITUTION AND TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD FINDING POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE SOCIAL CONFLICT OF COLOMBIA. WE APPEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE COUNTRY TO URGE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS. 10. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY IS A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION. 11. WE URGE THE LIBERAL PARTY TO POSTPONE ITS NATIONAL CONVENTION IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE PATRIOTIC UNION AND THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE. 12. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S CALL AND WE WILL PROMOTE THIS CALL THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. 13. IN DEFENSE OF A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY WE WILL MAINTAIN THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE CREATED. WE HEREBY ASK OUR FOLLOWERS AND ALL OUR COUNTRYMEN TO REMAIN ON A STATE OF ALERT. THIS COMMITTEE WILL HOLD A NEW MEETING TUESDAY 27 MARCH, AT 1500, IN THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE URGE ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES INTERESTED IN THESE OBJECTIVES TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS MEETING. RESOLUTION; DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, THE POPULAR MOVEMENT (WORDS INDISTINCT), THE BROAD FRONT (WORDS INDISTINCT), THE NATIONALIST ACTION FOR PEACE, AND THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19) WANT TO LEAVE ON RECORD THE FOLLOWING: THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS BETWEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND M-19 THAT BEGAN ON 10 JANUARY 1989 AND THAT PRODUCED ON 9 MARCH 1990 A PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE MURDER OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, BUT WILL NOT RESULT IN AN END TO THE SEARCH FOR PEACE BY THE TWO PARTIES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA. (END RECORDING)",

        "text": "FMLN-FDR (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT-REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT) TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR TREACHEROUS ATTACKS AGAINST CIVILIANS AND POLICE OFFICERS IN THE CAPITAL AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE, OPENLY IGNORING THE AGREEMENTS REACHED BY THEIR LEADERS WITH A GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IN GENEVA, SWITZERLAND. THE ARMED FORCES TELECOMMUNICATIONS INSTRUCTION CENTER (CITFA) REPORTED THAT A MAN AND A WOMAN WERE CRITICALLY WOUNDED WHEN THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELLING NEAR OLOCUILTA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, WAS MACHINEGUNNED BY FMLN TERRORISTS ON THE EVENING OF 4 APRIL. THE WOUNDED ARE MAURICIO CAMPOS AND CONCEPCION HERRERA, WHO WERE TAKEN TO A HEALTH CENTER BY THE RED CROSS, THE SOURCES ADDED. THE NATIONAL POLICE REPORTED THAT TWO OF ITS AGENTS AND A CIVILIAN WERE FIRED AT BY TERRORISTS AT 1800 ON 4 APRIL, AS THEY INSPECTED A CAR CRASH BETWEEN THE HIGHWAY TO COMALAPA AIRPORT AND 49TH SOUTH AVENUE IN THE MONTSERRAT NEIGHBORHOOD. \"THE POLICEMEN WERE MACHINEGUNNED DOWN BY PEOPLE IN A MOVING VEHICLE AND SUSTAINED WOUNDS WHICH HAVE LEFT THEM IN EXTREMELY CRITICAL CONDITION,\" A SECURITY CORPS SPOKESMAN SAID. THE TWO AGENTS WERE ASSISTED BY PEOPLE WHO REPUDIATED THE ATTACK. A PEDESTRIAN, LATER IDENTIFIED AS MANUEL ALVARO MENDOZA, WAS ALSO STRUCK BY THE BULLET AND HE IS AT ROSALES HOSPITAL. A MILITARY SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT A GROUP OF PERSONS WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS FMLN-FDR MEMBERS KIDNAPPED A PEASANT, JOSE MANUEL POSADA, NEAR LA COLMENA, IN EL CARMEN DISTRICT, CUSCATLAN DEPARTMENT. MEANWHILE, 9-YEAR-OLD YOHALMO ANTONIO ORTIZ WAS INJURED BY SHRAPNEL WHEN TERRORISTS THREW A BOMB AT CIVIL DEFENSE MEMBERS IN NEJAPA, NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WHILE HARASSING THE PARAMILITARY GROUP'S OUTPOST. THE BOY IS AT BLOOM HOSPITAL. IN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION AND THE FMLN-FDR LEADERS, THE LATTER PLEDGED NOT TO ENGAGE IN TERRORISTS ATTACKS THAT MIGHT DAMAGE ASSETS OR INJURE PERSONS, BUT \"URBAN COMMANDOS\" OR \"TERRORISTS SQUADS\" THAT OPERATE IN SAN SALVADOR HAVE EITHER NOT BEEN INFORMED OF THIS RESOLUTION OR THEY ACT INDEPENDENTLY, THE MILITARY SOURCES SAID. REFERRING TO THE 2 APRIL CAR BOMB EXPLOSION PERPETRATED IN SANTA TECLA, THE FMLN-FDR CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN A COMMUNIQUE, AND SAID THAT IT WAS \"AN ACTION AIMED DIRECTLY AT THE POLICE\" AND THAT \"THEY REGRET THE DEATH OF A CIVILIAN,\" BUT THEY DID NOT MENTION COMPENSATION FOR THE RELATIVES. ALSO, THE FMLN-FDR CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS'S SON-IN-LAW, ACCUSING HIM OF BEING A MILITARY PILOT -- WHEN IN FACT HE HAS BEEN A CIVILIAN PILOT AND HE WAS WORKING IN A SMALL AUTOMOBILE SPARE PARTS DISTRIBUTION COMPANY AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK. THE YOUNG MAN, OTTO MILLA, IS STILL IN A COMA AND HIS PANCREAS WAS REMOVED IN THE LATEST SURGICAL OPERATION.",

        "text": "GOOD AFTERNOON, WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED A STATEMENT ISSUED BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS CONCERNING THE MURDER OF MR. CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ. THE MESSAGE READS AS FOLLOWS: CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER IS A MONSTROUS CRIME THAT HAS CUT SHORT THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO HAD SHOWN HIS WILL FOR PEACE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO COLOMBIA. THE CRIME WAS DIRECTED AT HINDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND DESTROYING THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND M-19 (19 APRIL MOVEMENT) CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED, SURPASSING MANY OBSTACLES. IN THIS CASE, AS IN MANY OTHERS, THIS PAINFUL TRAGEDY SHOULD SERVE TO CONSOLIDATE THE IDEALS OF PEACE AND PLURALISM FOR WHICH SO MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE STRUGGLED -- ONE OF THEM, CARLOS PIZARRO. IT SHOULD SERVE TO REASSERT OUR REPUDIATION OF VIOLENCE AND OUR FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES. FURTHER ON THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE NOTES: PIZARRO'S RELATIVES AND HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT, AND I PERSONALLY, FEEL STRONG WRATH AND SADNESS, BUT WE WILL NOT BE DISCOURAGED. WE WILL UPHOLD THE BANNERS OF RECONCILIATION, PLURALISM, AND THE RIGHT TO FREELY AND PEACEFULLY EXPRESS ANY IDEA. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO UNMASK AND COMBAT ENEMIES OF PEACE. THE PRESIDENT ADDS IN HIS MESSAGE: I INTERPRET THE DESIRE OF ALL COLOMBIANS WHO ADMIRED CARLOS PIZARRO'S DEMOCRATIC VOCATION, BY WARNING THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TRAGIC MURDER THAT THEY WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN WORKED FOR SO HARD AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF POLITICAL FORCES AND THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR PEACE ON 11 MARCH TO OPEN A ROAD FOR PEACE THAT IS CLEAR, POSSIBLE, AND DEFINED. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE CONTINUES: YOU KNOW THAT DURING THIS PEACE PROCESS, MANY ENEMIES AND DIFFICULTIES WERE SURPASSED, BUT NONE HAS BEEN SO LARGE AS THIS TRAGEDY THAT HAS SHAKEN ALL COLOMBIANS. THE OBLIGATION THAT LIES BEFORE US IS TO KEEP OPEN THE ROAD TO PEACE THAT THE MURDERERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO WANT TO DESTROY. ARTICLE 95 OF THE ELECTORAL CODE INDICATES THAT WHEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DIES, ANOTHER PERSON IN HIS OWN MOVEMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE HIS PLACE. IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NORM, THE GOVERNMENT WILL OFFER EVERY FACILITY FOR THE REGISTRY OF A NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SO THAT HE CAN CONTINUE TO HOIST THE FLAGS OF PEACE AND PLURALISM AS IS PROPER FOR A DEMOCRATIC DEBATE. THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYS IN HIS MESSAGE: I HAVE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THE PEACE ADVISER TO MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH M-19 REPRESENTATIVES SO THAT TOGETHER THEY MAY STUDY ALTERNATIVES TO CONFRONT SUCH A SERIOUS SITUATION. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER WILL ALSO DIRECT CONTACTS WITH THE REST OF THE POLITICAL FORCES TO REQUEST THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT THE PRESENT SITUATION AND TO CONTINUE TO GIVE ALL THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES SO THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS MAY DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHAT IS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR LAWS. THE MESSAGE ENDS: I INVITE ALL COLOMBIANS WHO ARE TIRED OF SO MUCH VIOLENCE TO COME TO THE POLLS IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS AND VOTE FOR PEACE AND PLURALISM. I INVITE ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO JOIN IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE THREATENED BY VIOLENCE. IT IS TIME FOR GOOD SENSE AND PRUDENCE. IT IS TIME TO RISE TO THE OCCASION AND SHOW OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY. THIS IS THE TEXT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S MESSAGE ON THE MURDER MR. CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.",

        "text": "SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI STATED TODAY THAT IT WOULD BE NO PROBLEM FOR THE FOURTH PENAL JUDGE, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE CASE OF THE JESUITS MURDERED BY A GROUP OF SOLDIERS, TO ORDER THAT CADETS WHO ARE TAKING COURSES ABROAD RETURN TO THE COUNTRY. IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS WHO TESTIFIED DURING THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOW ATTENDING TRAINING COURSES ABROAD. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY SCHOOL'S REGISTRATION BOOK FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE PREMISES HAD BEEN LOST, INCLUDING THE PAGES THAT CORRESPOND TO NOVEMBER 1989. TODAY, CRISTIANI TALKED ABOUT THIS MATTER AND SAID THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE AND NOT JUST MAKE STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE PROBLEMS. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY PROBLEM IN THE OFFICERS RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY IF A JUDGE ORDERS THAT THEY COME TO TESTIFY. ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS FOR THE JUDGE TO SUMMON THEM; THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE COUNTRY TO TESTIFY AND, AFTER THAT, RETURNED TO THEIR TRAINING COURSES. GROUPS OF SOLDIERS ARE FREQUENTLY SENT ABROAD TO TAKE TRAINING COURSES TO MAKE THEM MORE PROFESSIONAL; THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO PERSONNEL FROM THE MILITARY SCHOOL, BUT FROM ALL ARMED FORCES UNITS. CONCERNING THE OTHER MATTER, THE JUDGE HAS TO INVESTIGATE IT. I BELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING THERE, THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE. TELL ME, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY ARE BROUGHT BACK FROM SUCHITOTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES IF THEY MUST TESTIFY BEFORE THE JUDGE? THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL. (END RECORDING) THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TODAY AT THE EL SALVADOR MILITARY AIRPORT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR COSTA RICA TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY OF PRESIDENT-ELECT RAFAEL CALDERON FOURNIER. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES CONDITIONING 50 PERCENT OF THE AID GIVEN TO OUR COUNTRY COULD CAUSE THE REBEL FRONT TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIONS. HE ACCUSED THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) OF USING DIALOGUE FOR TACTICAL REASONS. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) WE HAVE STATED THAT AN ACTION OF THIS TYPE WOULD BE VERY UNTIMELY, AS IT COULD MAKE THE MOST RADICAL FMLN MEMBERS DECIDE TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND, THUS, HINDER THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. (REPORTER) HOWEVER, (WORDS INDISTINCT) PRESSURE GOVERNMENT FOR THEM (WORDS INDISTINCT) WITH FMLN. (CRISTIANI) I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION: WHO HAS ALWAYS SHOWED GOODWILL AND SINCERELY SOUGHT AN AGREEMENT AND WHO HAS NOT DONE THIS? HISTORY SHOWS THAT IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS USED THE PROPOSALS BY (JOSE NAPOLEON) DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND MY OWN FOR TACTICAL REASONS. IT HAS NOT BEEN THE GOVERNMENTS. I BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND AND BE PRESSURED TO REALLY SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION. (END RECORDING) ALSO TODAY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AUTHORIZED A SPOKESMAN TO ANNOUNCE THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN WILL BE RENEWED ON 16 MAY. THE PANORAMA THAT SURROUNDS THIS NEW ENCOUNTER, HOWEVER, PRESENTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PATTERN FROM MEETINGS IN THE PAST, BECAUSE BOTH SECTORS HAVE MET WITH POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED AT THE (WORD INDISTINCT). FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DONE THE SAME WITH THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL FORCES, THE REBELS WILL TRY TO DO SO THIS WEEK. UNDOUBTEDLY, THE RESULTS THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE DIALOGUE COULD BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE OBTAINED DURING PAST NEGOTIATIONS, BECAUSE ALMOST ALL THE SECTORS THAT HAVE BECOME INVOLVED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE NEGOTIATING DEMAND THAT THE AGREEMENTS ATTAINED BE BASED ON INTERNAL COOPERATION.",
