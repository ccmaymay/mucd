THE NEW JUDGE, RICARDO MEJIA, OVERTURNED THE RULING TO RELEASE THE EIGHT PEOPLE ACCUSED OF KIDAPPING AT LEAST SIX WEALTHY SALVADORANS IN THE EARLY 1980'S. SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO ANNOUNCED LARIOS' DISMISSAL AND SUSPENDED HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. \"BASED ON A REVIEW OF LARIOS' IRREGULAR RULING, ONE CAN CONCLUDE THAT HIS BEHAVIOR IS UNBECOMING AN OFFICIAL WORTHY OF THE SUPREME COURT'S TRUST. WE ARE DISMAYED BY THAT JUDGE'S CONDUCT,\" HE NOTED. MOREOVER, MEJIA OVERTURNED THE RULING ORDERING THE RELEASE OF ORLANDO LLOVERA BALLET, LIEUTENANT ISIDRO LOPEZ, MAJOR ALFREDO JIMENEZ, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE KIDNAPPING RING. LARIOS DECIDED ON FRIDAY TO RELEASE THE MEMBERS OF THE KIDNAPPING RING, WHICH INCLUDED SOME ARMY OFFICERS AND SYMPATHIZERS OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), WHICH WON THE 19 MARCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. \"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE SUPREME COURT HAS LEVIED THIS KIND OF SANCTION IN A CASE SETTING A PRECEDENT IN JUDICIAL CORRUPTION,\" A COURT OFFICIAL ASSERTED, REFERRING TO LARIOS' DISMISSAL. LARIOS IS ALSO ACCUSED OF RELEASING MEMBERS OF A DRUG TRAFFICKING RING SOME YEARS AGO. BECAUSE THE RULING ON THE KIDNAPPERS WAS OVERTURNED, \"THE CASE GOES BACK TO THE LOWER COURTS,\" THE NEW JUDGE SAID. THE KIDNAPPERS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN UNDER ARREST SINCE APRIL 1986, WERE ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING SEVERAL BUSINESSMEN FOR HIGH SUMS OF MONEY. LARIOS'S RULING IN FAVOR OF THE KIDNAPPERS PROMPTED A BITTER REACTION FROM GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL, AND PROFESSIONAL SECTORS. THE NATIONAL AD COUNCIL, REPRESENTING NEWS MEDIA ANNOUNCERS, HAS URGED THAT THE KIDNAPPERS BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW \"SO THAT THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM THE SUFFERING OF OTHERS ARE PUNISHED.\"",

(BEGIN RECORDING) (BIAFARA) THAT IS YAIR KLEIN IN FRONT. HE IS THE COLONEL WEARING THE DARK BLUE SHIRT. THE THIN PERSON BEHIND HIM WEARING THE LIGHT BLUE SHIRT IS TEDDY, WHO WAS THE TRANSLATOR. THERE WERE FIVE ISRAELI INSTRUCTORS. I REMEMBER THE NAMES: SADAKA, AMANCIA, YAIR, AND TEDDY. I CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE FIFTH ONE. THERE WERE 11 BRITISH INSTRUCTORS. WE USED TO CALL THAT ONE DAVID. THIS MAN WAS AN EXPERT IN EXPLOSIVES. HE INSTRUCTED US ON HOW TO USE EXPLOSIVES. (END RECORDING) THESE WERE STATEMENTS MADE BY BIAFARA TO THE U.S. SENATE IN WHICH WE LEARNED OF A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES, WHO WERE TRAINING PARAMILITARY GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION, AND THE BRITISH MERCENARIES WHO CAME TO THE COUNTRY ALLEGEDLY TO ASSASSINATE PABLO ESCOBAR. BIAFARA KNEW BOTH GROUPS OF MERCENARIES. ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENTS GIVEN TO DAS LAST MARCH, NOT ONLY DID ISRAELI MERCENARIES TRAIN ASSASSINS IN MIDDLE MAGDALENA, THERE WAS ALSO A GROUP OF 11 BRITISH MERCENARIES, WHO GAVE LESSONS TO 50 STUDENTS. AMONG THE INSTRUCTORS THERE WAS PETER MCLISE, THE NAME OF ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OPERATION AGAINST PABLO ESCOBAR, AND DAVID, WHO BIAFARA CLEARLY IDENTIFIED. HE WAS DAVID TOMKINS, THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE PLOT AGAINST ESCOBAR. ACCORDING TO BIAFARA, MOST BRITISH INSTRUCTORS HAD TATOOS ON THEIR BREASTS, ARMS, AND SHOULDERS, JUST AS WE CAN SEE ON THE VIDEO TAPED BY THE BRITISH MEN WHO PREPARED THE OPERATION AGAINST ESCOBAR.

        "text": "ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION: TODAY, 9 MARCH, WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE SIGNED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMISSION ASKING US TO BEGIN THE PEACE TALKS. WE HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, EXPRESSING OUR WILLINGNESS TO HOLD A MEETING. THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION'S LETTER MAKES NO MENTION OF ANY MOVE TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS. IT DOES NOT EVEN CONSIDER INCLUDING THIS TOPIC ON THE MEETING'S AGENDA. ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO HOLD THE ELECTIONS ON 19 MARCH. CONSEQUENTLY, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) HEREBY INFORMS THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE OF THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST CLEARLY AND PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS WILLING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON CONFINING THE ARMY TO ITS BARRACKS ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTIONS, ESTABLISHING AN ELECTORAL CODE BY CONSENSUS, PROVIDING ABSENTEE VOTING FOR SALVADORANS LIVING ABROAD, RESTRUCTURING THE CENTRAL ELECTIONS COUNCIL, AND FORMING A COUNCIL FOR VERIFICATION. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST EXPRESS THE STATE POWERS' WILLINGNESS TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS FOR 5 MONTHS, ONCE A CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN AGREED UPON. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS WILLING TO BRING MILITARY COMMANDERS AND OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLITICAL MURDERS AND CRIMES TO TRIAL, TO REDUCE THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES TO THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IT HAD IN 1968, AND TO DISBAND THE SECURITY FORCES TO FORM A NEW CIVIL POLICE. WE REITERATE OUR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS PERMANENTLY CEASING THE ARMED STRUGGLE. 2. IF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AGREES TO THE ABOVE REQUESTS, THE FMLN WILL AGREE TO A MEETING AND IS WILLING TO IMMEDIATELY DECIDE ON A DATE AND A TIME FOR THE MEETING. THE FMLN IS EVEN WILLING TO HOLD THE MEETING OUTSIDE EL SALVADOR. AS A PART OF THIS MEETING, WE ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES STAFF ON A CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL BRING ABOUT A PERMANENT AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. 3. IF NO SUCH AGREEMENT IS REACHED, THEN THERE IS NO POINT IN HOLDING THE MEETING PRIOR TO 19 MARCH, BECAUSE IT WILL SIMPLY BE USED BY BOTH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDC) AND THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) IN THEIR ELECTION DISPUTE. THE ELECTIONS PLAY NO ROLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE; THEY ONLY SERVE TO PROVIDE A FALSE JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUING THE WAR. 4. WE AWAIT A RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION. EL SALVADOR, 9 MARCH 1989 FMLN GENERAL COMMAND (SIGNED) COMMANDER SALVADOR SANCHEZ CEREN COMMANDER FRANCISCO JOVEL COMMANDER JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL COMMANDER EDUARDO SANCHO COMMANDER JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS",

THE CHILEAN FOREIGN UNDER SECRETARY MADE THIS STATEMENT IN REPLY TO U.S. NEWSPAPER REPORTS STATING THAT THE TREATY WOULD BE PARTIALLY RESPECTED. FOLLOWING ARE VARGAS CARRENO'S STATEMENTS AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HE HELD IN BUENOS AIRES BEFORE CONCLUDING HIS OFFICIAL VISIT TO ARGENTINA: (BEGIN RECORDING) (VARGAS) THIS TREATY (WORDS INDISTINCT) USED BY THE UNITED STATES IN 1989, DURING THE PAST ADMINISTRATION, TO SOLVE TWO PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE LETELIER CASE: THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION AND THE PROBLEM OF THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF ORLANDO LETELIER AND HIS (WORDS INDISTINCT) ASSISTANT. IT HAS BEEN AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO USE THE TREATY EXCLUSIVELY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF COMPENSATION; THAT IS THE OBJECTIVE WHEN WE REFER TO ITS PARTIAL USE. (WORDS INDISTINCT) SO AS FOR THE COMPENSATION SUBJECT, IT WILL BE USED. WE ARE USING THE MECHANISM CREATED BY THE FIVE-MEMBER COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY THE TREATY. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS TREATY WAS PERTINENT FOR THE EARLY DECADES OF THIS CENTURY BUT IS NO LONGER IN KEEPING WITH CURRENT INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES. (END RECORDING) DURING THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH ARGENTINE AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS, VARGAS CARRENO ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM WILL VISIT CHILE IN AUGUST IN RESPONSE TO AN INVITATION FROM CHILEAN PRESIDENT PATRICIO AYLWIN, WHO WILL ALSO VISIT ARGENTINA AT AN AS YET UNDETERMINED DATE. VARGAS CARRENO NOTED HIS SATISFACTION WITH HIS MEETINGS IN BUENOS AIRES WITH FOREIGN MINISTER DOMINGO CAVALLO AND RAUL CARIGNANO, UNDER SECRETARY FOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS. VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS INITIAL CONTACT THE BINATIONAL COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY THE CHILEAN-ARGENTINE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY, WHICH WAS SIGNED IN 1984, WILL MEET NEXT JULY. HE SAID THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD FORMAL AND INFORMAL TALKS TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS OF COMMON INTEREST, SPEED UP THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, AND INCREASE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION. REGARDING THE SITUATION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILEAN CITIZENS LIVING IN ARGENTINA -- A TOTAL HE ESTIMATED AT 800,000 -- VARGAS CARRENO SAID THAT PRESIDENT AYLWIN'S GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED AN OFFICE TO HELP THOSE CITIZENS LIVING ABROAD FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO RETURN TO CHILE, ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN ARGENTINA'S PATAGONIA REGION WHO ARE BEING TREATED INHUMANELY, ESPECIALLY BY BUSINESSMEN IN THE BORDER AREA, AS REPORTED BY AN ARGENTINE JOURNALIST.",

        "text": "THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS CALLED A SPECIAL SESSION OF CONGRESS FOR TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS SITUATION OF PANAMA AND TO DENOUNCE THE INTER-AMERICAN RECIPROCAL ASSISTANCE TREATY, TIAR, FOR ITS INEFFECTIVENESS. THIS WAS ANNOUNCED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA AT THE CONCLUSION OF A COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE TODAY. THE PRESIDENT ALSO EXPRESSED HIS SURPRISE OVER THE MILDNESS WITH WHICH THE REST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE REACTED TO THE U.S. AGGRESSION AGAINST PANAMA. PRESIDENT GARCIA ALSO SAID THAT THE FUEL PRICE INCREASE WILL ALLOW PETROPERU (STATE PETROLEUM AGENCY) TO OPERATE. (BEGIN RECORDING) (UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER) WHAT IMPORTANT SUBJECTS WERE DISCUSSED IN THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING TODAY? (GARCIA) THE MAIN SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO CALL A SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL SESSION ON 22 AND 23 DECEMBER TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS SITUATION CREATED BY THE U.S. INVASION IN PANAMA. THE SECOND IMPORTANT SUBJECT WAS THE DECISION TO DENOUNCE THE TIAR, A MILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT GROUPS ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND THE UNITED STATES AND WHICH, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HAS PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTELY INEFFECTIVE AND PARTIAL. THE MALVINAS ISLANDS SITUATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. ACCORDING TO THE TIAR, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED ARGENTINA, BUT IT DID EXACTLY THE CONTRARY, SUPPORTING THE UNITED KINGDOM. NOW, IN THIS CASE WITH PANAMA, THE TIAR HAS NOT SERVED ANY PURPOSE. RATHER, IT HAS SERVED TO MASK THE U.S. INVASION OF PANAMA. THEREFORE, SINCE WE CONSIDER THE TIAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND SENSELESS, WE, AS A REPUBLIC, MUST DENOUNCE IT. WE MUST WITHDRAW OUR SIGNATURE FROM THE TIAR. THIS MUST BE DONE THROUGH CONGRESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CALLED A SPECIAL SESSION. (REPORTER) SEVERAL SECTORS HAVE DESCRIBED THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW THE PERUVIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AS A HASTY DECISION. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? (GARCIA) I THINK THAT THOSE MUST BE SECTORS COMMITTED TO THE INVASION. THEY MUST SUPPORT A RIGHTIST CONCEPT BY WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAS THE HEGEMONIC RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD OUR DESTINY AND TO DECIDE WHO CAN GOVERN US AND WHO CANNOT. AS PERUVIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, WE FEEL THAT THE AGGRESSIVE AND BLOODY ACTION BY U.S. TROOPS TO OCCUPY A SMALL COUNTRY IS A VIOLATION. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NEARLY 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS IN PANAMANIAN TERRITORY. THEY HAVE KILLED MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO IMPOSE A NEW GOVERNMENT. THUS, AS LONG AS THOSE TROOPS REMAIN THERE, AS LONG AS THIS VIOLATION TO LATIN AMERICA IS MAINTAINED, OUR AMBASSADOR WILL NOT STAY IN THAT COUNTRY. THIS DOES NOT IMPLY A BREAK IN RELATIONS; IT REPRESENTS A CLEAR GESTURE OF CONDEMNATION AND DISLIKE. AS LONG AS A U.S. SOLDIER VIOLATES THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, WE WILL KEEP OUR AMBASSADOR HERE. AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS AND PANAMA REMAINS OCCUPIED, THE PANAMANIAN AND PERUVIAN FLAGS WILL REMAIN TOGETHER. (REPORTER) DON'T YOU THINK THAT THIS ATTITUDE COULD HARM CERTAIN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES; THAT IS, COULDN'T IT JEOPARDIZE THE IMF LOAN? (GARCIA) NOT AT ALL. THESE ARE TWO ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT THINGS. THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF ARE ONE THING; THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ATTITUDE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT ABUSES ITS ECONOMIC AND MILITARY POWER WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS SOMETHING ELSE. BESIDES, WE SHOULD MENTION SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. AS FOR PANAMANIAN-U.S. RELATIONS, THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THE MAIN ACCOMPLICES IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY. WHEN ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE IN 1984, WHEN ARNULFO ARIAS SHOULD HAVE WON, THE UNITED STATES DECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT THAT ARIAS SHOULD WIN, SO A LARGE FRAUD -- AS IT WAS DECLARED AT THE TIME -- WAS CARRIED OUT TO PLACE NICOLAS ARDITO BARLETTA IN POWER. THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE ARDITO WERE THE AMERICANS. ARDITO WAS PLACED IN THE PRESIDENCY BY NORIEGA. IN 1985 NORIEGA REMOVED ARDITO AND PUT ERIC ARTURO DEL VALLE IN HIS PLACE. THE AMERICANS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED DEL VALLE AS PRESIDENT. THEREFORE, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN NORIEGA'S ACCOMPLICE IN DEPRIVING PANAMA OF DEMOCRACY. WE DENOUNCED THIS. NORIEGA IS A CREATION OF THE UNITED STATES. IT HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN SAID THAT NORIEGA WORKED WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH THE U.S. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, WHERE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS ONCE CHIEF. THEREFORE, NOW THAT THE MAID IS ANSWERING BACK, MAKING CLAIMS TO THE PANAMA CANAL AND WANTING TO BECOME INDEPENDENT FROM THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED STATES SUDDENLY DISCOVERS THAT SHE IS A DRUG TRAFFICKER AND THAT SHE DOES NOT SERVE ITS INTERESTS, SO THEY SEND 30,000 U.S. SOLDIERS TO PANAMA. THIS IS AN ABUSE. IT IS A VIOLATION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ANOTHER STATE. NO HONORABLE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY SHOULD TOLERATE THIS INVASION WITHOUT ACTIVELY AND OPENLY CONDEMNING IT. ONE WAY TO CONDEMN IT AND EXPRESS DISAPPROVAL OF IT IS TO SAY THAT AS LONG AS THE TROOPS INVADING LATIN AMERICA REMAIN, WE DO NOT NEED TO MAINTAIN OUR AMBASSADOR THERE. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA), A PERUVIAN GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, HAS SENT A LETTER TO PERUVIAN CARDINAL JUAN LANDAZURI, PROPOSING THAT A DIALOGUE BE HELD TO RESTORE PEACE TO PERU. IN ITS LETTER, WHICH IS PARTIALLY PUBLISHED IN TODAY'S LA REPUBLICA, A LIMA NEWSPAPER, THE MRTA OUTLINES SEVERAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT WILL HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE MRTA LETTER IS DATED 26 MARCH, THE SAME DAY CARDINAL LANDAZURI STATED OVER A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION THAT THE CHURCH WOULD BE WILLING TO MEDIATE WITH VIOLENCE-ORIENTED MOVEMENTS UNDER ACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS FOR DIALOGUE. THE CARDINAL ADDED THAT, BECAUSE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE IDEOLOGIES, THESE MOVEMENTS HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY DIALOGUE WHATSOEVER. HE ALSO NOTED THAT APPEALS MADE BY THE CHURCH HAVE GONE UNHEEDED. ACCORDING TO LA REPUBLICA, THE MRTA LETTER SAYS THAT THE MRTA \"NATIONAL LEADERSHIP CAREFULLY LISTENED TO YOUR EASTER MESSAGE TO THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IN WHICH YOU REFLECTED ON THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY, AND MADE AN APPEAL TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN UP ARMS.\" THUS, THE LETTER ADDS, THE MRTA \"DEEMS IT IMPORTANT TO INFORM YOU OF OUR OPINION AND OUR PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD.\" THE LETTER SAYS THAT THE CHURCH MUST PLAY A DECISIVE ROLE IN \"HUMANIZING THIS WAR,\" AND THAT MOST VICTIMS OF THIS WAR ARE \"UNARMED CIVILIANS.\" THE MRTA BELIEVES THAT IN ORDER TO HUMANIZE THIS CONFLICT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES MUST \"STOP COMMITTING CRIMES AGAINST UNARMED CIVILIANS, PRISONERS MUST BE TREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VIENNA CONVENTION, TORTURE AND HUMAN RIGHTS' CRIMES MUST END, AND PARAMILITARY GANGS MUST BE DISMANTLED.\" THE MRTA ASKS THE CHURCH TO DEMAND THAT THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT CHANGE ITS ECONOMIC POLICY. THE MRTA SAYS: \"THE CHURCH MUST DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT PUT AN END TO REPRESSION AND CRIMES AGAINST THE PEOPLE; THAT HIGH MORAL STANDARDS BE OBSERVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF PERUVIAN POLITICAL LIFE; AND THAT STIFF PUNISHMENT BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO COMMIT IMMORAL, CRIMINAL ACTS AGAINST THE PEOPLE.\" THE MRTA LETTER CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT ONLY THIS WAY WILL THE CHURCH TRULY \"CONTRIBUTE TO FINDING A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFRONTATION.\" MONSIGNOR RICARDO DURAND FLORES, PRESIDENT OF THE PERUVIAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, TODAY SAID THAT THE CHURCH \"CANNOT REJECT ANY PROPOSAL FROM VIOLENCE-ORIENTED ORGANIZATIONS.\" MSGR DURAND SAID THAT IF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS MADE THE EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE WILL IMMEDIATELY CALL A MEETING OF ITS STANDING COMMITTEE \"TO STUDY THE SITUATION.\" VICTOR POLAY, ONE OF THE MRTA'S LEADERS, IS CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY AND FACING TRIAL ON CHARGES OF TERRORISM. MORE THAN 13,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN PERU SINCE 1980, WHEN THE MAOIST SHINING PATH ORGANIZATION STARTED ITS WAVE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, WHICH HAS ALSO CAUSED HEAVY MATERIAL DAMAGE.",

THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG) HAS ALSO REITERATED TO CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT ITS WILLINGNESS TO ATTEND A DIALOGUE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE; HOWEVER, IT REGRETS THE FACT THAT UP TO NOW, \"THE PRESIDENT AND HIS DEFENSE MINISTER, GENERAL ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO, HAVE REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION.\" GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AND URNG REPRESENTATIVES MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MADRID, SPAIN, IN 1987, BUT THE MEETING ENDED WITHOUT SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS BEING REACHED. \"WE HAVE INSISTED ON A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE URNG BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN THOUGH ALL OF CENTRAL AMERICA IS WILLING TO HOLD DIALOGUES, PRESIDENT CEREZO AND THE GRAMAJO CLIQUE REFUSE TO DO SO,\" THE URNG STATED IN A PAID ADVERTISEMENT PUBLISHED IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS. IN REFERENCE TO THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE THAT IS SWEEPING THE COUNTRY, THE URNG, MADE UP OF FOUR REBEL GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN GUATEMALA, SAID THAT THE PEOPLE \"ARE LIVING ONE OF THE DARKEST AND DEADLIEST CHAPTERS IN THEIR HISTORY.\" WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND \"FEELS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERTAKE A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE AND TALKS WITH ALL THE FORCES AND POLITICAL PARTIES, WITH ALL THE POPULAR, RELIGIOUS, BUSINESS GROUPS, AND WITH THE HONEST SOLDIERS, SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN FIND A REAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT SITUATION.\" \"THE ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED COULD INCLUDE -- IN ADDITION TO THE VITAL ISSUES LIKE REPRESSION AND THE INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT -- ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT, WITHOUT PRESSURES OR IMF MEASURES, OF A PROSPEROUS ECONOMY,\" THE GUERRILLA'S STATEMENT ADDS. \"WITH 16 MONTHS AND A FEW DAYS LEFT IN THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL TERM, PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS PROMISES AND HAS ONLY MADE THE SITUATION WORSE,\" THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE STATES. \"INSTEAD OF CHANGES, REPRESSION, TERROR, INSTABILITY, CHAOS, AND CORRUPTION CONTINUE, AND THE GUATEMALAN PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF LIES, FRUSTRATION, AND MANIPULATION,\" THE REBELS ADD. THE URNG STATED THAT CEREZO'S GOVERNMENT, THE FIRST CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY HAS HAD SINCE 1970, HAS PROVEN ITSELF TO BE \"A COUNTERINSURGENT, REPRESSIVE, AND TERRORIST REGIME.\" THE GUATEMALAN REBELS BELIEVE THAT \"THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEW WAVE OF REPRESSION AND TERROR THAT ONLY ADDS TO THE MORE THAN 100,000 PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED, 40,000 WHO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED OR ARE MISSING, 1 MILLION LOCALLY DISPLACED AND 46,000 WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN MEXICO SINCE 1954.\" THE URNG TODAY ALSO PUBLISHED A COPY OF A LETTER SENT TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR IN WHICH IT REQUESTS THAT HE OFFER HIS GOOD OFFICES \"SO THAT A REGIME THAT RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS, THE INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND CONVENTIONS, JUSTICE, FREEDOM, AND DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL IN GUATEMALA.\" THE REBELS SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S ASSURANCE THAT THE REBEL MOVEMENT HAS BEEN ANNIHILATED \"IS NOT TRUE\" AND ADDED THAT, QUITE THE CONTRARY, \"THE POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY WAR HAS INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.\" THE URNG CLAIMS THAT \"THE URNG MILITARY GROUPS ARE NOW FIGHTING IN 11 OF THE 22 DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING GUATEMALA CITY,\" AND HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS ON \"IMPORTANT TARGETS.\" ACCORDING TO ITS MILITARY REPORT, THE URNG HAS CARRIED OUT APPROXIMATELY 688 MILITARY ACTIONS AND INFLICTED 1,172 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY SINCE LAST APRIL. THE GUATEMALAN ARMY CLAIMS THAT THE REBELS HAVE BEEN MILITARILY DEFEATED AND THAT ONLY ABOUT 1,000 REBELS ARE ACTIVE IN SOME ISOLATED REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. TODAY'S STATEMENT WAS SIGNED BY ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR ILOM, CARLOS GONZALEZ, AND PABLO MONSANTO, COMMANDERS OF THE FOUR CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAKE UP THE URNG: THE POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY (EGP), THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS (ORPA), THE GUATEMALAN LABOR PARTY (PGT-COMMUNIST), AND THE REBEL ARMED FORCES (FAR).",

THEY CANNOT CONTINUE CLOSING THEIR EYES TO THE BOMBINGS, TO THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE POOR NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN SALVADOR, TO THE MOTHERS WHO APPEAR CRYING ON TELEVISION. IT IS GOOD THAT THE NETWORK PRESENTS THESE PICTURES OF PEOPLE CRYING, MANIPULATING THEIR EMOTIONS. THOSE TEARS WERE SHED OVER 50 YEARS OF OPPRESSION AND MISERY, AND OVER THE BOMBINGS THAT HAVE DESTROYED ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD. OFFICERS, THE BOMBS HAVE CAUSED ALL THAT SORROW AND THE DESTRUCTION OF 500 HOUSES IN ZACAMIL. AS WE WERE SAYING, OFFICERS, YOU MUST ASK YOURSELVES: WHO ARE YOU DYING FOR? FOR COLONEL PONCE'S MANSIONS IN MIAMI? FOR GENERAL BUSTILLO'S MANSIONS? WHY ARE THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS DYING HERE? WHY ARE THE LIEUTENANTS, THE CAPITAINS DYING, WHILE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HIERARCHY ARE CONFORTABLY SITTING IN THEIR AIR-CONDITIONED OFFICES BEING GUARDED WHILE THEY ARE AT EASE, BUT NOT REALLY AT EASE AS COMBAT IS TAKING PLACE JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THEIR OFFICE. OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS, CAPTAINS, THIS IS THE APPEAL THE FMLN WANTS MAKE TO YOU TODAY, AT A TIME WHEN THE FUTURE OF THE FATHERLAND IS AT STAKE? YOU MUST THINK THIS OVER, YOU MUST MAKE A DECISION, AND YOU MUST DO THIS SOON. HISTORY IS MOVING FAST, AND THE TIME IS RIPE. SO WHEN YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TELLING YOU. IF YOU ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION, THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SAYING. IF WE ARE DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION HERE, WHY IS THIS CONSTITUTION BEING VIOLATED BY THOSE RAMBOS SENT BY PRESIDENT BUSH TO EL SALVADOR? YOU ALL KNOW THIS LITTLE GROUP OF RAMBOS IS GOOD FOR NOTHING, AS THEY ARE COWARDS. THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE SHERATON HOTEL, BECAUSE THE GUERRILLAS WERE THERE. THEY ARE COWARDS, JUST LIKE THEIR SYSTEM. THEY ARE TINHORN RAMBOS, WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD. AS WE SAID YESTERDAY, IF THOSE MEN WHO LEFT THE SHERATON LIKE COMMON CRIMINALS COVERING THEIR FACES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE TRAINING THE ARMED FORCES, WE CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER WHY THE FMLN IS DEFEATING THE TACTICS TAUGHT BY THEM. THEY ARE NO GOOD, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND OUR PEOPLE, THEY UNDERESTIMATE OUR PEOPLE. OFFICERS, YOU KNOW THOSE U.S. ADVISERS UNDERESTIMATE YOU, THEY LOOK DOWN ON YOU, AS LITTLE INDIANS, AS DONKEYS. YOU KNOW HOW THEY THINK OF YOU. YOU KOW THEY MOCK THE SALVADORAN OFFICERS. OFFICERS, YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW THESE U.S. ADVISERS TREAT OUR SOLDIERS. THEY ARE HAUGHTY, ARROGANT, AND COWARDS. YOU SAW THEM AT THE SHERATON HOTEL, PISSING IN THEIR PANTS, THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE HOTEL. A COMMISSION WENT THERE, THE RED CROSS WENT THERE, BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SURE OF THEMSELVES DURING THE TRUCE, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE COWARDS. WE WANT THE CIN (NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER), THAT FASCIST NETWORK THAT IS SILENCING OUR PEOPLE, TO PRESENT THE FILMS OF THE ADVISORS LEAVING THE HOTEL. WE CHALLENGE THE NETWORK TO PRESENT THOSE FILMS OF THE ADVISORS LEAVING THE SHERATON, WITH THEIR FACES COVERED AS IF THEY WERE CAR THIEVES. THAT IS THE WAY THE U.S. ADVISERS -- THE RAMBOS, THE SUPERMEN -- LEFT THE SHERATON. THESE RAMBOS ARE NOT GOING TO SAVE ANYONE, AS THEY CANNOT EVEN SAVE THEMSELVES.",

FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!\" THIS CAMPAIGN IMMERSED THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND AND THE CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION IN CONFUSION AND INSECURITY SINCE THE BEGINNING; AND IT SUCCESSFULLY CONTINUES IN ITS SECOND DAY OF FIGHTING. 2. THE FMLN FIGHTERS ARE USING ALL THEIR INTELLIGENCE, ENERGY, UNSELFISHNESS, AND PATRIOTISM SO THAT A JUST PEACE IS ACHIEVED IN THE COUNTRY BASED ON AN AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY DESIGNED TO COUNTER THE GENOCIDAL REPLY THAT THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP HAS RESPONDED WITH. 3. SALVADORANS WHO HAVE WITHSTOOD A BLOODY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP FOR ALMOST 60 YEARS SEE MORE CLEARLY TODAY THE NEED TO DEVELOP THEIR LEGITIMATE DEFENSE AGAINST THE REPRESSION WHICH HAS BEEN STEPPED UP BY THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY HOSTILITY OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S ADMINISTRATION; AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO SUPPORT AND JOIN THE STRUGGLE FOR OUR COUNTRY'S LIBERTY. 4. WE URGE THE HONEST AND PATRIOTIC MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES TO SERIOUSLY REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY FACING THE GUERRILLA ARMY OF THE FMLN, BUT A WHOLE SECTOR WHICH CLAIMS ITS RIGHT TO REBEL. WE SPECIFICALLY URGE THE SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS IN THE BATTLEFIELD TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR STRUGGLE IS NOT BEING PERSONALLY WAGED AGAINST YOU, BUT RATHER AGAINST THE ANTIPOPULAR INTERESTS WHICH ARE BEING DEFENDED BY THE ARMED FORCES UPON ORDERS FROM THE FASCISTS. 5. THE GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES OF THE WORLD ARE CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE LATEST EVENTS IN EL SALVADOR AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION WILL BE VALUABLE IN ACHIEVING A NATIONAL CONSENSUS BASED ON DEMOCRACY, A SOLUTION AMONG SALVADORANS, AND NO FOREIGN INTERVENTION. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST HELP ACHIEVE A JUST AND DURABLE PEACE, THUS AVOIDING MORE BLOODSHED. 6. THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND WANTS TO REPORT THE ATROCITIES BEING PERPETRATED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY THE ARMED FORCES WHO ARE INDISCRIMINATELY BOMBING DENSELY POPULATED AREAS IN SAN SALVADOR, AND ISSUING DEATH THREATS AGAINST ALL THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS, THUS PROVING THE REGIME'S WEAKNESS AND SHOWING ITS ANTIPOPULAR AND ANTIPATRIOTIC ESSENCE. 7. WE ALSO URGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP CREATE SPECIAL ZONES WHERE CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY, AND WOUNDED PEOPLE FROM THE BATTLE ZONES CAN BE EVACUATED. OUT WITH THE FASCISTS!

ON THAT OCCASION PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH BOTH DELEGATIONS SEPARATELY.

SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT \"SALVADORAN RIGHTIST SECTORS AND SOLDIERS\" COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME, YESTERDAY ARMY SPOKESMEN WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT.

        "text": "AFTER NEARLY A 2-MONTH ABSENCE FROM THE NATIONAL PRESS, MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON HOLDS THE VIEW THAT THE ARMED FORCES SHOULD NOT BE CRITICIZED FOR THE ISOLATED BEHAVIOR OF SOME OF ITS MEMBERS. THE ARENA (NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE) LEADER IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE ARMED FORCES THEMSELVES WERE THE ONES THAT EXERTED PRESSURE SO THAT THE JESUITS' MURDER CASE COULD BE CLEARED-UP. (BEGIN RECORDING) (D'AUBUISSON) IT WAS NOT THE INSTITUTION (ARMED FORCES) THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM. REGRETTABLY SOME OF ITS MEMBERS DID IT AND NOW THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES ARE UNDER PRESSURE FOR POLITICAL REASONS. HOWEVER, WE MUST REALIZE THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE ARMED FORCES THAT WE HAVE THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, WITH A HOPE THAT OUR COUNTRY DEVELOPS AND RECOVERS. IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE PASS JUDGMENT OR CRITICIZE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN ON ALL THE OFFICERS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WHO HAVE HAD TO PUT UP WITH THESE ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO THE INTENSE WORK THEY HAVE HAD FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. (END RECORDING) D'AUBUISSON SAID THAT ONCE THE MURDER OF THE SIX JESUITS HAS BEEN CLEARED UP, U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE CONTINUATION OF U.S. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY. (BEGIN RECORDING) (D'AUBUISSON) THE JESUITS' CASE WAS A DETERMINING FACTOR. BUT NOW THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN FULLY SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF THE FBI, SCOTLAND YARD, AND INVESTIGATORS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SERIOUS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE CAN BE ANY DOUBT NOW ABOUT RECEIVING THE AID, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE TREMENDOUS OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT). FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE, IF THE SITUATION DID ARISE (WHEREBY AID WAS SUSPENDED), THIS WOULD ONLY FAVOR THE FMLN. I KNOW THE FMLN HAS A WHOLE RANGE OF SUPPORT GROUPS THAT HANDLE DISINFORMATION AND MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF THINGS HERE WERE DISASTROUS. FOR EXAMPLE, INFORMATION ABROAD IS THAT THE AIR FORCE LEVELED ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE SALVADORANS KNOW THAT THE AIR FORCE WAS EXCESSIVELY CAUTIOUS AND DID AN EXCELLENT JOB REPELLING THIS ATTACK WITH A MINIMUM OF CIVILIANS WOUNDED. FOR THAT MATTER, IF WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE THINGS, U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS IN PANAMA WERE MORE CLUMSY -- THERE THEY SET A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ON FIRE. (END RECORDING) THE ARENA LEADER ALSO DENIED THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRESIDENT CRISTIANI AND HIMSELF. ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL PRESS AGENCIES, THE DECISION OF THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT TO PROSECUTE THE MILITARY MEN INVOLVED IN THE JESUITS' MURDER CAUSED DIVISION WITHIN THE PARTY. D'AUBUISSON DENIED THIS WAS TRUE. (BEGIN RECORDING) (D'AUBUISSON) NOT IN THE LEAST. THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN ANY DIFFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT CRISTIANI. ON THE CONTRARY, WE ARE VERY CLOSE AND GRATEFUL FOR THE GREAT EFFORT, WORK, AND THE MAGNIFICENT JOB PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS DOING. THIS IS REASON FOR PRIDE NOT ONLY AMONG FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI BUT FOR THE PARTY AND FRIENDS OF THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. (END RECORDING) IN COMMENTING ON THE DIALOGUE WITH THE FMLN, D'AUBUISSON SUPPORTED PRESIDENT CRITIANI'S INITIATIVE OF ENGAGING THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL. (BEGIN RECORDING) (D'AUBUISSON) I DO NOT THINK HE HAS THE TIME TO ACT AS MEDIATOR; HOWEVER, HE COULD ACT AS A GUARANTOR, RECEIVING RESULTS OF THESE TALKS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS MADE. (END RECORDING) MAJ ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON, CURRENTLY AN ARENA DEPUTY, SAID THAT THIS YEAR HE WILL DEDICATE HIS TIME TO EXPAND AND REORGANIZE THE PARTY TO GET READY FOR THE 1991 MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. HE WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BE AN ARENA DEPUTY IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE PERIOD, BECAUSE HE, ALONG WITH OTHER FORMER LEGISLATORS, WILL CONCENTRATE THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ON THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT.",

THESE AGREEMENTS ARE A VICTORY FOR THE REVOLUTIONARY, PROGRESSIVE, INDEPENDENT, AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES OF THE REGION, AND AS SUCH, WE STRONGLY PRAISE THEM. 2. THESE AGREEMENTS SEAL THE POLITICAL DEATH OF THE CONTRAS AND DECLARE TO THE WORLD THE FAILURE OF THE POLICY OF AGGRESSION THAT THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION INITIATED AND CARRIED OUT AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF CENTRAL AMERICA. 3. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES WERE PREPARED TO PUT FORWARD A THEORY OF PARALLELS, ALL OF THEIR ALLEGED EVIDENCE WAS DERIDED AND DISCARDED. 4. CRISTIANI HAS SIGNED OFF ON THE CONTRAS' DEATH AND ACKNOWLEDGED BEFORE THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT THE FMLN IS A FORCE WITH WHICH IT MUST TALK AND NEGOTIATE. HE WENT TO TELA WITH A DIALOGUE PLAN TO COVER UP THE WAR, BUT HE WAS FORCED, UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, TO NEGOTIATE FOR PEACE WITH THE FMLN. CRISTIANI'S DIALOGUE COMMISSION, IN FACT, HAS BEEN DEMOBILIZED. 5. CRISTIANI WAS FORCED TO SIGN A PLEDGE FOR DEMOCRATIZATION WHEN HIS PLANS WAS TO FASCISTIZE EL SALVADOR. 6. THE FMLN REAFFIRMS ITS RESOLVE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES, THE SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOPRIC, AND OTHER SOCIAL FORCES TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CONTRAS WERE A MERCENARY FORCE MAINTAINED BY THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ATTACKED NICARAGUA FROM HONDURAS, AND WHICH SHOULD AND COULD BE DEMOBILIZED. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN IS A NATIONAL FORCE THAT HAS REASONS FOR BEING AT WAR, AND WITH WHICH PEACE MUST BE NEGOTIATED. NO ONE CAN DEMOBILIZE THE FMLN BECAUSE IT IS WITHIN THE COUNTRY AND IS A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL FORCE. THE FMLN CALLS ON ALL FELLOW PATRIOTS WHO HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN HONDURAS, NICARAGUA, COSTA RICA, GUATEMALA, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD TO RETURN TO THE FATHERLAND. THEY ARE PROTECTED BY THE TELA AGREEMENTS. WE ASK ALL SALVADORANS TO DEMAND OF CRISTIANI THAT, WITHOUT FURTHER STRATAGEMS, HE CARRY OUT A SERIOUS NEGOTIATION; FULFILL HIS PLEDGE TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY; STOP THE REPRESSION, KIDNAPPING, AND TORTURE; RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS; GUARANTEE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; RESPECT REFORM; AND ABOLISH THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT ARE DEEPENING THE WAR. (SIGNED) FMLN GENERAL COMMAND (DATED) 7 AUGUST 1989",

PEASANTS, WHOSE HARDENED FACES AND BODIES REVEAL THE ENDURANCE OF LONG WORK DAYS, PARTICIPATED IN THE MARCH ALONG WITH WOMEN, WHO IN MANY CASES WERE CARRYING THEIR BABIES WHO NEVER KNEW THEIR FATHERS BECAUSE THEY ARE MISSING OR BECAUSE THEY WERE MURDERED BY SECURITY FORCES OR DEATH SQUADS, ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY TOLD AFP. YOUNG PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES MARCHED ALONG WITH THEM SHOUTING SLOGANS AND WITH THEIR FACES COVERED WITH RED HANDKERCHIEFS. THEY CARRIED IRON RODS AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS IN THEIR BAGS, \"IN CASE THEY WERE NEEDED TO CONFRONT THE POLICE OR IN CASE THEY HAD TO CHARGE AGAINST A GOVERNMENT VEHICLE.\" IN THEIR STRING BAGS, THE YOUNG PEOPLE -- SOME OF WHOM CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO PROMOTE THE REACTIVATION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASSES -- ALSO CARRIED SPRAY PAINT CANS, WHICH THEY WERE READY TO USE TO PAINT SLOGANS ON WALLS AND VEHICLES AT THE SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY. \"WHAT IS OUR BATTLE CRY? BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM,\" THEY SHOUTED AS THEY MARCHED DOWN THE MAIN AVENUES OF THE CAPITAL CARRYING HUGE RED FLAGS WITH A BLACK CIRCLE IN THE CENTER, THE MPTTL SYMBOL. ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES AND HIGH PARTY LEADERS, THE MPTTL DEMONSTRATORS ARE \"A MINORITY, INSTRUMENTS OF THE TERRORISTS OR SIMPLY GUERRILLAS THAT CAME DOWN THE MOUNTAINS TO PROMOTE CHAOS.\" LEFTIST LEADERS, HOWEVER, SAID THE MARCH HELD TODAY WAS THE \"EXPRESSION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE 5 MILLION SALVADORANS, A MAJORITY, WHICH FOR MANY YEARS, SINCE THE 1932 MASSACRE, HAS BEEN SUBJUGATED BY RIFLES AND HUNGER BUT IS NOW AWAKENING.\"",

IT IS A TASK IN WHICH EACH OF US HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE. COLOMBIA HAS SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME EVEN MORE DIFFICULT MOMENTS. IT HAS FACED DECISIVELY AND EMERGED VICTORIOUSLY FROM EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN SITUATIONS. THAT PAST HAS CREATED SOLID INSTITUTIONS.

THE DAS SENT A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHICH WAS PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE LIBERAL NEWSPAPER EL TIEMPO. THE REPORT CONFIRMS THAT THERE IS A COLLABERATION BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS, AND THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES IN COLOMBIA -- HIRED BY THE EXTREME RIGHT-WING DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS. THE OFFICIAL ORGANIZATION ASSERTS THAT THE RECENTLY CREATED EXTREME RIGHTIST MOVEMENT OF NATIONAL RESTORATION (MORENA) \"MUST BE IDENTIFIED AS THE CULMINATION OF A SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, GROUPS OF HIRED GUNMEN TRAINED BY FOREIGN MERCENARIES, AND AGRARIAN BUSINESSMEN WHO ARE TIRED OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS' CONSTANT HARASSMENT.\" THE REPORT INDICATES THAT BRITISH AND ISRAELI MERCENARIES IDENTIFIED AS JOHN OWEN, DAVE TOMKINS, R. PAXTON, P. GLASGOW, A. DEWER, AND P. ATHERTON ENTERED COLOMBIA THROUGH ELDORADO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN JULY, BUT THE INFORMATION DOES NOT GIVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL NATIONALITIES. THE DAS ADDS THAT DEAN SHELLEY, PETER MCALEESE, ALEX LENOX, AND ANDRES GIBSON ENTERED THE COUNTRY IN PREVIOUSLY AND SETTLED IN THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUPS' MILITARY TRAINING CAMPS IN PUERTO BOYACA, MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION (CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY), LA AZULITA (SOUTHERN PUTUMAYO), PUERTO LOPEZ (META DEPARTMENT), AND EL RECREO (CAQUETA DEPARTMENT) ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLATLANDS. RADIO STATIONS' REPORTS ADDED THAT COLONEL YAIR KLEIN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AMONG THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES BY THE SECRET SERVICES OF HIS COUNTRY. KLEIN WAS COMMANDER OF A PARATROOPERS' UNIT IN 1983 AND APPARENTLY HAS A PRIVATE SECURITY AGENCY IN ISRAEL. ABRAHAM TZADAKA AND JACOBO BRINE WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED BY THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. ON A NATIONAL NEWSCAST BROADCAST SEVERAL WEEKS AGO A VIDEO WHICH SHOWS THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES WEARING BLUE UNIFORMS DURING WAR MANEUVERS WITH THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS FAR RIGHT-WING GROUPS' PRIVATE ARMY. THE SCENES WERE REPRODUCED BY THE NBC TELEVISION NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES. PREVIOUS REPORTS FROM THE DAS, REVEALED IN COLOMBIA, INDICATE THAT THE COLOMBIANS TRAINED BY THE MERCENARIES INCLUDE PERSONS LINKED WITH THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA REGION AND THE RECENTLY CREATED MORENA. THE FIRST PERSONS TO NOTIFY THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL OF THE NATION, THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY, ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES AMONG THE DRUG-TRAFFICKERS FAR RIGHT-WING ARMED GROUPS WERE DESERTERS FROM THE MIDDLE MAGDALENA SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS -- IDENTIFIED AS JESUS ALBERTO MOLINA URREA, RICAURTE DUQUE ARBOLEDA, AND VICTOR ARBOLEDA DUQUE. ACCORDING TO THE DESERTERS' DECLARATIONS, THE ISRAELI MERCENARIES CANNOT SPEAK SPANISH AND THEY FREQUENTLY MET WITH GONZALO DE JESUS PEREZ, HENRY PEREZ, AND MARCELO PEREZ. ACCORDING TO THE DAS REPORT REVEALED TODAY, \"THE PEREZES,\" ARE IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF MIDDLE MAGDALENA CATTLEMEN (ACDEGAM), THE SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS, AND MORENA; AND THE AUTHORITIES CHARGE THEM WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF PEASANTS IN URABA, LOCATED IN THE COUNTRY'S NORTHWESTERN AREA.",

        "text": "ON 30 NOVEMBER WHEN U.S. PRESIDENT BUSH SET FORTH TO MALTA TO MEET WITH SOVIET LEADER GORBACHEV, A REPORT FROM ANGOLA SAID THAT A CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) AIRPLANE ON A CLANDESTINE MISSION OF DELIVERING WEAPONS TO THE ANTIGOVERNMENT NATIONAL UNION FOR THE TOTAL INDEPENDENCE OF ANGOLA (UNITA) CRASHED IN SOUTHERN ANGOLA ON 27 NOVEMBER AND THAT THE FOUR AMERICANS ON THE PLANE WERE KILLED. TODAY BOTH THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMED THE CRASH, BUT THEY REFUSED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER THE AMERICANS WHO WERE KILLED WERE CIA OFFICIALS, OR ON THE NATURE OF THE PLANE'S MISSION. THIS IS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE RESPONSE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MADE A FEW DAYS AGO IN CONNECTION WITH A PLANE CRASH IN EL SALVADOR. AFTER A PLANE CARRYING WEAPONS TO THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS CRASHED ON 25 NOVEMBER, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER PROMPTLY INSTRUCTED THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE ON THAT SAME EVENING TO SUMMON THE SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES TO PROTEST TO THE SOVIET UNION FOR UNDERMINING PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND \"FAILING TO EXERCISE ITS INFLUENCE\" TO STOP CUBA AND NICARAGUA FROM DELIVERING WEAPONS TO THE GUERRILLAS IN EL SALVADOR. IN THIS CONNECTION, A U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL POINTED OUT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH WOULD PRESENT THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHILE DISCUSSING PROBLEMS OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS WITH SOVIET LEADERS DURING THEIR MEDITERRANEAN MEETING. SOME OFFICIALS EVEN SAID THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE IS THE \"PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE\" TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS, AND THAT ONLY WHEN THE USSR MAKES FURTHER CONCESSIONS ON THE CENTRAL AMERICA ISSUE WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THE SOVIET UNION. IN A CEASEFIRE ACCORD SIGNED ON 24 JUNE THIS YEAR, UNITA AND THE ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO SEEK WAYS AND MEANS TO CONCLUDE THE CIVIL WAR THAT HAD GONE ON FOR 14 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KEEPS SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA. ACCORDING TO U.S. NEWSPAPERS, EVER SINCE THE SOUTH AFRICAN AUTHORITIES STOPPED SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO UNITA LAST APRIL, THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME UNITA'S MAIN WEAPON SUPPLIER. THE SECRET THAT THE UNITED STATES' MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO UNITA INCREASED FROM $15 MILLION TO $50 MILLION THIS YEAR WAS REVEALED AFTER THE CRASH OF THE CIA'S WEAPON CARRIER. NOW, EVEN THE U.S. PRESS HAS ASKED THIS QUESTION: COULD IT PREVENT PRESIDENT BUSH FROM PRESENTING HIS CRITICISM WHEN PROBLEMS OF REGIONAL CONFLICTS ARE DISCUSSED WHEN HE MEETS THE SOVIET LEADER? A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAID: \"NOT AT ALL,\" \"WE WILL NOT PLACE (THE TWO) ON A PAR.\" A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALSO SAID THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE \"APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE\" TO UNITA IN THE FUTURE.",

        "text": "AS A LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE OVER THE STATEMENT THAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF THE DRUGS PRODUCED IN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT COLOMBIA, PERU, AND BOLIVIA ARE TO BLAME FOR PRODUCING THE DRUGS; LET'S CALL THOSE COUNTRIES TO TALK WITH THEM. THAT SEEMS TO ME A VERY ETHNOCENTRIC VISION; IT LOOKS AT THIS MATTER FROM ONLY ONE SIDE. OUR PEASANTS ARE POOR PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE WHATEVER IS MOST PROFITABLE, AND COCA CULTIVATION HAPPENS TO BE MOST PROFITABLE FOR THEM. THIS IS SO, SPEAKING COLDLY, HONESTLY, AND SINCERELY. AS PRESIDENT OF PERU I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT MY PEOPLE, THE HUALLAGE REGION PEASANTS, CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS CRIMINALS OR AS PEOPLE WHO MUST BE JAILED FOR PRODUCING COCA LEAVES. WE HAVE EXCHANGED THESE VIEWS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND WE REACHED THESE CONCLUSIONS. WE MUST ALSO NOTE THAT THIS MATTER HAS BEEN HANDLED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLICITY. AFTER THE DEATH OF CARLOS GALAN, A GREAT COLOMBIAN LEADER, THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE INTENDED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ASSASSINATION, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THEN EXTENDED SOME ASSISTANCE. THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PRESENT TO THE WORLD AS THOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAD SENT AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF AIRCRAFT, HUNDREDS OF HELICOPTERS, AND THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COLOMBIA. AS I WAS ABLE TO SEE IN BOGOTA, ONLY HELICOPTERS, SOME OF WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED EARLIER BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT, WERE SENT. I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT SOME OF THOSE HELICOPTERS HAD BEEN USED PREVIOUSLY IN PERU. I HAVE SAID THAT, IF THERE IS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, I SUPPORT PRESIDENT BUSH FOR DEFENDING U.S. SOCIETY. IF HE HAS THAT MUCH CONVICTION, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF WHAT IS SPENT IN ARMS AND MILITARY EXPENDITURES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO REPLACE COCA PLANTATIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE GENERAL SITUATION IN LATIN AMERICA. WE HAVE TALKED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK WITH PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXCHANGE OPINIONS. THEN, AS PRESIDENT BUSH SAID, A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS WILL BE WELCOME. BUT THE MEETING SHOULD ALSO BE ATTENDED BY EUROPE, WHICH HAS A FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST IN THE FUTURE. (CORRESPONDENT) WOULD THE IDEA BE TO HOLD A MEETING IN THE NEAR FUTURE OF PERU, COLOMBIA, AND BOLIVIA WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EEC? (GARCIA) YES, BECAUSE DRUG TRAFFICKING IS A GROWING PROBLEM. CARTELS HAVE SPROUTED IN COLOMBIA -- MONOPOLIES THAT TRY TO ELECT DEPUTIES AND SENATORS TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT. THOSE MONOPOLIES MIGHT EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO OUR COUNTRIES IF WE DO NOT STOP THIS GROWING PROBLEM. THE SITUATION CAN BECOME WORSE IN BOLIVIA, WHERE IT WAS SAID THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD AN INFLUENCE ON A DICTATORIAL MILITARY REGIME. IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF PROTECTING THE MORALITY OF HUMANITY; IT IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF DEFENDING THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS A PRIMARY ROLE IN WORLD LEADERSHIP; IT IS ESSENTIALLY A MATTER OF DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY -- THE LEGITIMACY AND CLEANLINESS OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE. I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A MEETING OF THE THREE PRESIDENTS FIRST, SO THAT WE CAN LET THE U.S. PRESIDENT KNOW OUR VIEWS ON THE OVERALL PROBLEM. (CORRESPONDENT) WILL YOU PROPOSE THAT MEETING, MR PRESIDENT? (GARCIA) I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME A LEADING ROLE. THE IDEA EMERGED IN A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BARCO, AND I WILL TALK LATER WITH PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA. (CORRESPONDENT) A MEETING BETWEEN YOU AND PRESIDENT BUSH LATE THIS MONTH HAS BEEN MENTIONED. IS THIS TRUE, MR PRESIDENT? (GARCIA) NO, I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN MERE SPECULATION IN THE PRESS. FOR THE TIME BEING I HAVE DISCARDED THE IDEA OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP ABROAD. I DO NOT SEE THE CONCRETE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE CAN MEET SOMETIME BEFORE 28 JULY 1990. (CORRESPONDENT) CHANGING THE SUBJECT, MR PRESIDENT -- MUCH HAS BEEN SAID IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE EXPULSION OF PERU FROM THE IMF. WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS, AND WHAT WOULD EXPULSION MEAN? (GARCIA) WELL, FIRST, IT IS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PERU TO BE EXPELLED FROM THE IMF. SECOND, THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND ALARMISM REGARDING THE MATTER. WHAT IS THE IMF? IT IS SOME SORT OF CREDITOR BANK CREATED IN 1946 THAT LENDS MONEY TO COUNTRIES WITH BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS; THAT IS, WITH PROBLEMS WITH THEIR FOREIGN RESERVES LEVELS. WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100 MILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FOR IMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS. THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TO FACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES. AN IMF CREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM. ADJUSTMENT MEANS REDUCING THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL CONSUMPTION SO AS TO SPARE THE COUNTRY'S RESERVES IN ORDER TO MEET DEBT OBLIGATIONS. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "NEXT JUNE AN ENTIRE U.S. ARMY COMPANY WILL CARRY OUT JOINT MANEUVERS WITH ARGENTINE TROOPS IN A PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL REGION. THE MANEUVERS, DESIGNED TO TEACH THE ARGENTINE OFFICERS THE LATEST TECHNIQUES AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, FALL WITHIN THE COMPREHENSIVE MILITARY EXCHANGE PLAN. GENERAL MAXWELL THURMAN'S VISIT IS ALSO PART OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PLAN. ACCORDING TO RELIABLE SOURCES, THE RECENT VISIT FROM THE UNITED STATES OF 10 LIEUTENANT COLONELS, THREE COLONELS, AND EIGHT CIVILIAN EXPERTS IN DEFENSE STRATEGY, REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RENEWED U.S.-ARGENTINE MILITARY RELATIONSHIP. THE SAME SOURCES HAVE STATED THAT THE GRADUAL AND RESTRICTED PARTICIPATION OF THE ARMY IN MANEUVERS DESIGNED TO PRACTICE FIGHTING AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTRY AND EVEN BY THE PRESIDENT. THE MILITARY GROUP THAT ARRIVED IN ARGENTINA ON 6 MAY CARRIED OUT WAR GAMES AT THE WAR SCHOOL AND THE CAMPO DE MAYO MILITARY SCHOOL AND, LATER ON, CARRIED OUT FIELD MANEUVERS. OTHER FORCES PARTICIPATED IN THE THREE-DAY MANEUVERS THAT WERE CARRIED OUT ON AN ISLAND IN THE RIVER PLATE DELTA. ACCORDING TO A WITNESS, THE MANEUVERS CONSISTED OF \"RAIDS\" INCLUDING \"SURPRISE\" SITUATIONS THAT FORCED THE U.S. TROOPS TO ENDURE BAD WEATHER AND BAD TERRAIN. ACCORDING TO THE FINAL EVALUATION, THE MANEUVERS WERE REGARDED AS \"SATISFACTORY AND SUCCESSFUL\". ACCORDING TO THE PROGRAM, A COMPLETE U.S. COMPANY THAT WILL TRAIN WITH ARGENTINE TROOPS IN A PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL REGION IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE IN JUNE. FOREIGN MINISTRY SOURCES CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF EXCHANGE PLANS BUT STATED THAT GENERAL THURMAN HAD PROPOSED TO THE CHIEFS OF STAFF THE POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT JOINT MANEUVERS TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING DURING A LUNCHEON. THE SOURCES STATED THAT THE CHIEFS OF STAFF HAVE MADE SOME OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL AND DID NOT REACH ANY AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, SOURCES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE RECENT MANEUVERS ON THE ISLAND HAD A DIFFERENT OPINION AND RATIFIED THAT ANOTHER MANEUVER WOULD BE HELD IN A PROVINCE OF THE LITTORAL IN JUNE. ANYHOW, THE STATEMENT OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN FALLS WITHIN THE DIPLOMATIC POLICY THAT MAY PARTLY DIFFER WITH THE MILITARY AND DEFENSE POLICIES, AS WAS POINTED OUT BY A SECTOR OF THE MEDIA YESTERDAY. MOREOVER, GENERAL THURMAN WILL REMAIN IN SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHE UNTIL SATURDAY, 19 MAY, AND THAT SAME DAY WILL FLY TO THE IGUAZU FALLS FROM WHERE HE WILL RETURN TO HIS MILITARY BASE IN PANAMA. THE ONLY PURPOSE OF GENERAL THURMAN'S VISIT WAS TO OFFER THE DEFENSE MINISTRY ALL THE TECHNOLOGY, KNOW HOW, AND WEAPONS FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING WHICH, IN MANY CASES TURNS INTO NARCOTERRORISM, IN OTHER WORDS, THE USE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF WEAPONS AND TERRORIST ACTIONS. THURMAN'S VISIT, WHICH TOOK THE UNITED STATES A WHOLE YEAR TO ARRANGE, WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE U.S. SENATE. WITHIN THE SAME FRAMEWORK, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE HAVE JUST RECEIVED WEAPONS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT AMOUNTING TO $50 MILLION, WHICH IS ENOUGH TO EQUIP TWO COMPLETE BATTALIONS IN CHARGE OF FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THEREFORE, THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING LAUNCHED BY THE UNITED STATES IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY OF THE SOUTHERN CONE OF WHICH ARGENTINA -- ACCORDING TO EXPERTS -- MUST PARTICIPATE OUT OF FEAR OF A GROWING ISOLATION. IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT THE RESTRICTED AND GRADUAL -- BY NO MEANS MASSIVE -- PARTICIPATION OF THE ARMY AND PROBABLY THE NAVY IN MANEUVERS FOR THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING MAY BE THE KEY THAT WILL FINALLY ALLOW THE ARMED FORCES TO ACQUIRE THE WAR MATERIEL, SPARE PARTS AND OTHER ELEMENTS IT NEEDS. THE ANALYSTS HAVE RECALLED THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO FIGHT CORRUPTION -- A PROBLEM THAT ALSO WORRIES PRESIDENT CARLOS MENEM AND VICE PRESIDENT EDUARDO DUHALDE -- FALLS WITHIN THE SAME FRAMEWORK BECAUSE, IN THE EXPERTS' OPINION, IT IS THE EQUIVALENT TO DRUG TRAFFICKING. HIGHLY RELIABLE SOURCES HAVE RECALLED THAT 30 DAYS AGO PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SENT PRESIDENT MENEM TWO VOLUMES OF A U.S. EDITION ON TECHNIQUES TO FIGHT CORRUPTION.",

OUR CORRESPONDENT MARIA ALEJANDRA GONZALEZ WAS THERE. (BEGIN RECORDING) (GONZALEZ) THE PEACE PROCESS BETWEEN M-19 AND THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZED THIS WEEK DUE TO THE MURDER OF TWO MEMBERS OF THAT GUERRILLA ORGANIZATION, WHICH OCCURRED AT THE BORDER BETWEEN CAUCA AND VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENTS. CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE SITUATION. (PIZARRO) WE ARE LIVING A SLOW MOTION PEACE PROCESS. WE NEED A PEACE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH COLOMBIANS CAN FEEL THAT PEACE HAS ARRIVED, INSTEAD OF A PROCESS THAT IS SIMPLY A PERMANENT AND ENDLESS ACCOUNT OF PEACE TRAGEDIES. (GONZALEZ) OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS, PRESIDENTIAL PEACE ADVISER RAFAEL PARDO AND DEPUTY GOVERNMENT MINISTER JOSE NOE RIOS MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE M-19 COMMAND. THE PARTICIPANTS REAFFIRMED THEIR DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE WITH THE PEACE EFFORTS. A FORUM FOR LIFE, DEMOCRACY, AND PROGRESS WILL BE HELD IN SANTO DOMINGO THIS WEEKEND, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL LEADERS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. THE EVENT WILL INCLUDE SPORTS AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. COMMISSIONS WILL WORK ON DEVELOPMENT PLANS. AT LEAST 2,000 PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND AT THE PEACE CAMP.",

        "text": "TODAY SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI REJECTED A REBEL PROPOSAL TO IMMEDIATELY NEGOTIATE A CEASE-FIRE WITH THE ARMY UNDER OAS AND UNITED NATIONS SUPERVISION; HOWEVER, HE DID EXPRESS HIS INTENTION TO SEEK A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY. THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE ATTACKED THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR WITH MACHINEGUN FIRE AND ROCKETS JUST AS PRESIDENT CRISTIANI REJECTED THE DIALOGUE PROPOSAL MADE BY THE GUERRILLAS ON 22 NOVEMBER. FOUR \"PUSH AND PULL\" PLANES AND TWO HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS OPENED FIRE ON ALLEGED FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) COLUMNS IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR. \"THEIR PROPOSAL IS NOT SERIOUS, (THE REBELS) ARE ONCE AGAIN SAYING THAT THERE ARE TWO ARMED FORCES. IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS ONLY ONE ARMED FORCE,\" CRISTIANI SAID. HE ADDED THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION ENTAILS THAT THE GUERRILLAS END THE VIOLENCE. THE PRESIDENT, ACCOMPANIED BY COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES, SAID IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT THE FMLN PROPOSAL \"IS NOT VERY SERIOUS\" BECAUSE \"IT IS NOT AIMED AT THE GOVERNMENT BUT AT THE ARMY, WHICH IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT,\" HE SAID. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE NEW FMLN PROPOSAL IS \"PROPAGANDIST\" AND IS ONLY MEANT TO GAIN SOME TIME IN VIEW OF THE \"MILITARY DEFEAT SUFFERED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.\" CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO SEEK A RATIONAL SOLUTION TO THE MILITARY CONFLICT IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT HE CATEGORICALLY EMPHASIZED THAT THIS MEANS THAT THE GUERRILLAS MUST LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. \"WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE GUERRILLAS TO REGROUP AND BEGIN ATTACKING AGAIN. IF THEY WANT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEY SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND PEACEFULLY JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS,\" CRISTIANI SAID. THE PRESIDENT WARNED THAT \"THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO FIGHT MILITARILY. IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE FMLN CONTINUES TO BEHAVE THIS WAY, NOT LISTENING TO REASON, AND NOT ENDING THIS MADNESS,\" THE RIGHTIST PRESIDENT SAID. THE NEWS CONFERENCE, HELD WITH SOME 50 JOURNALISTS, WAS ABRUPTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE HEAVY BOMBINGS CARRIED OUT BY THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE AGAINST ALLEGED GUERRILLA COLUMNS. FOLLOWING THE FIRST BOMBINGS, WHICH ROCKED THE MILITARY OFFICES WHERE THE NEWS CONFERENCE WAS BEING HELD, CRISTIANI AND PONCE RESUMED CONTROL OF THE CONFERENCE AND EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACK WAS THE RESULT OF AN OPERATION IN PURSUIT OF THE \"GUERRILLAS FLEEING IN DISARRAY.\" THE AIR FORCE BOMBING BEGAN SHORTLY BEFORE THE CURFEW, WHICH BEGAN AT 1800 (0000 GMT) UNTIL 0600 IN THE MORNING (1200 GMT), JUST WHEN THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WERE RETURNING HOME. THE HEAVY EXPLOSIONS CAUSED ALARM AMONG THE POPULATION IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR AND IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN HURT. ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE \"HAS BEEN A FAILURE\" NOT ONLY MILITARILY, BUT POLITICALLY AS WELL BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO INCITE THE PEOPLE TO REBELLION, AS THEY PLANNED. THE PROPOSAL SIGNED BY THE TOP FIVE FMLN COMMANDERS AND READ ON THE OFFICIAL REBEL STATION, CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS, HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A REBEL MILITARY OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN 12 DAYS AGO AND WHICH HAS LEFT MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE DEAD, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.",

AN INTERIOR MINISTRY SOURCE CONFIRMED TO BARRICADA THAT A CONTRA DESERTER PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS A REFUGEE ENTERED THE COUNTRY WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE REPATRIATED BY THE ACNUR. THE TELA AGREEMENTS HAVE CAUSED HAVOC NOT ONLY IN THE CONTRA RANKS, BUT ALSO IN THE REFUGEE CAMPS. THEIR DESPERATION TO RETURN TO NICARAGUA IS SUCH THAT MORE THAN 160 PERSONS TRIED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY ON 24 AUGUST THROUGH THE MURUPUCHI AND CERRO LA PIEDRA BORDER POSTS, BUT THE HONDURAN ARMY STOPPED THEM BECAUSE THEY LACKED THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS. ACCORDING TO JOSE TOMAS OSORIO, THE REFUGEES TRUST THE GUARANTEES OFFERED BY THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT. THIS WAS ASCERTAINED BY SEVERAL JOURNALISTS AT THE CERRO LA PIEDRA BORDER POST. SEVERAL PERSONS QUICKLY GOT OUT OF A VEHICLE BUT THE HONDURAN TROOPS' PRESENCE FRUSTRATED THEIR PLAN. THE RED CROSS' BRANCH IN JALAPA HAS INSTALLED A RECEPTION POST IN CERRO LA PIEDRA, BEHIND THE TROJES CEMETERY, TO AVOID TRAGEDIES LIKE THE ONE WHICH OCCURRED LAST WEEK, WHEN A YOUTH FELL INTO A MINED FIELD. THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOW BE ABLE TO CROSS THE BORDER, IF THE HONDURAN ARMY ALLOWS THEM, WITHOUT FACING ANY DANGER. RED CROSS PRESIDENT DENIS GUZMAN, WHO IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE PEACE COMMISSION, SPOKE ON 25 AUGUST WITH THE PERSON COMMANDING THE HONDURAN BORDER POST. HE SAID THAT THE RED CROSS WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO RETURN TO NICARAGUA. THE HONDURAN OFFICER SAID: \"WE HAVE NO INFORMATION BUT, IF MY COMMANDER AUTHORIZES IT, WE WILL NOT OBJECT AND WILL LET THEM PASS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT LET ANYONE CROSS THROUGH HERE FOR THE TIME BEING.\" SEVERAL REPATRIATED PERSONS RETURNING ON 23 AUGUST THROUGH LAS MANOS CONFIRMED THE PROBLEMS OF THE REFUGEES AT THE CAMPS: \"THERE IS NO FREEDOM TO WORK, THE FOOD IS RATIONED, THE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS HUNGRY, AND WE LIVED LIKE ANIMALS IN A CORRAL,\" IT WAS STATED BY ERNESTINA UMANZOR, WHO WAS KIDNAPPED AT THE CIFUENTES BORDER REGION AND LATER WAS REPATRIATED. REFERRING TO THE CONTRAS, THE NICARAGUANS LIVING IN HONDURAN TERRITORY SAID THAT THE FORMER \"ARE OUTSIDE THE LAW; THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO; THEY MUST PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS; THEY MUST BE DEMOBILIZED; THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS GOING TO THIRD COUNTRIES; THEY MUST RETURN TO THEIR HOMELAND,\" IT WAS ASSERTED BY DOMINGO OROZCO. THE REPATRIATED PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED AT TEOTECACINTE WERE WELCOMED BY LOCAL PEOPLE, WHO WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR RETURN AND SAID THEY WOULD SUPPORT THOSE WHO WISH TO TILL IDLE AND ABANDONED LANDS.",

WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU MILITARY INFORMATION FROM THE METROPOLITAN WAR FRONT, AS FOLLOWS: THERE HAS BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST ATLACATL BATTALION ARMORED VEHICLES IN CUSCATANCINGO. AT 0700, THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE AMBUSH IN WHICH SIX ARMORED VEHICLES WERE DESTROYED. THE AMBUSH WAS STAGED AGAINST ATLACATL BATTALION TROOPS IN CUSCATANCINGO WHO WERE ON THEIR WAY TO REINFORCE ENEMY POSITIONS UNDER ATTACK IN VARIOUS POINTS OF THE CAPITAL. OUR FORCES USED ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND SMALL ARMS FIRE, AS WELL AS EXPLOSIVES, TO AMBUSH THIS CONVOY, DESTROYING SIX ARMORED VEHICLES. IN ADDITION, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION (FMLN) FIGHTERS ATTACKED BELLOSO BATTALION TROOPS IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE. THE BELLOSO BATTALION CALLED FOR AIR SUPPORT, WHICH IT RECEIVED, BUT THIS HAS RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES BECAUSE THE HELICOPTERS USED HAVE BEEN BOMBING AND STRAFING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE AYUTUXTEPEQUE AREA. THE DESPERATE AIR SUPPORT HAS RESULTED IN MORE CIVILIAN VICTIMS. MEANWHILE, FMLN FORCES BEGAN ATTACKING ENEMY POSITIONS IN LOS SANTOS, BOSQUES DEL RIO, AND UNICENTRO, IN SOYAPANGO. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT BARRICADES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING BUILT IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR'S NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SECTORS. THESE ARE BARRICADES BUILT BY YOUTHS, STUDENTS, WORKERS, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS TO HELP WITH FOOD AND INFORMATION AND WHO, WITH THEIR OWN HANDS, ARE BUILDING BARRICADES AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF THE VANGUARD: THE FMLN. WE ARE RECEIVING A REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT THE FIGHTING WHICH HAD DECREASED IN THE UNIVERSITY AREA RESUMED AT 0600 THIS MORNING.",

        "text": "FOLLOWING THE U.S. INVASION OF GRENADA ISLAND, THE WORLD DISCARDED ANY FURTHER POSSIBILITY OF A U.S. ARMED OPERATION AGAINST ANOTHER NATION OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT, DESPITE THE DETERIORATION OF ITS RELATIONS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND PROVOCATIONS AGAINST THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE U.S. WOULD CONFINE ITS PARTICIPATION TO SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING MOVEMENTS AIMED AT OUSTING GOVERNMENTS OR, AS IN THE CASE OF NICARAGUA, OF SUPPORTING REBEL FORCES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET BY THE WHITE HOUSE. THE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING IN PANAMA HAVE SURPRISED THE WORLD BECAUSE, DESPITE GENERAL MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA'S CHALLENGING ATTITUDE, NO ONE THOUGHT THE U.S. WOULD INVADE PANAMA. NORIEGA WAS CERTAIN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT DO SO, AND SUPPOSED THAT U.S. ATTITUDES AGAINST HIM WOULD CONSIST OF SPONSORING REBELLION, SUCH AS THE RECENT 3-OCTOBER ATTEMPT, WHEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES TO REBEL AGAINST THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF. NORIEGA NEVER THOUGHT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD EVER CONDUCT A MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST PANAMA, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE U.S. TROOPS BASED ON THE CANAL ZONE. HE CONTINUED UNDER THIS IMPRESSION BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THESE TROOPS CHANGED FROM THEIR ROLE OF SURVEILLANCE, NOT EVEN WHEN WASHINGTON PROMOTED THE REBELLION OF SOME YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE PANAMANIAN FORCES. THIS EXCESSIVE SECURITY DISTRACTED NORIEGA AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO CHALLENGE THE U.S. POLICIES. NORIEGA DID NOT BELIEVE THE U.S. THREATS AND HE ADOPTED AN OMNIPOTENT STANCE, LIKE HIS RECENT DECISION TO APPOINT HIMSELF THE SUPREME LEADER OF PANAMA. NORIEGA BELIEVED THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SUBVERSION IN HIS COUNTRY, AND THAT THE U.S. DECISION TO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION CURRENTLY IN EXILE WOULD PRODUCE MOVEMENTS AGAINST HIS REGIME, OR THAT A COMMANDO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP HIM. AS A RESULT OF THIS BELIEF, HE INCREASED THE STRENGTH OF THE MILITARY FORCES AND EQUIPPED MANY CIVILIANS WHO SUPPORTED HIM WITH WEAPONS TO BE READY TO DISMANTLE MOVEMENTS THAT TRIED TO DESTABILIZE HIS GOVERNMENT. AS THE CLOCKS STRUCK MIDNIGHT IN PANAMA, THE U.S. FORCES BEGAN AN OPERATION AGAINST THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCE BARRACKS. THE TROOPS ALREADY BASED IN PANAMA, AND THOSE FLOWN IN FROM BASES IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER CITIES NEAR PANAMA, STARTED A MASSIVE ATTACK TO OUST GEN NORIEGA. THE INVASION, WHICH SEEMED POSSIBLE TO SOME AND TO OTHERS (WORDS INDISTINCT), WERE MAINLY CONDUCTED TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN DECLARED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LATIN AMERICAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY THE U.S. COURTS. EARLY THIS MORNING, SOURCES CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THAT THE OPERATION WAS AIMED AT CAPTURING NORIEGA AND TAKING HIM TO THE UNITED STATES TO BE TRIED FOR THE CRIMES ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY THE U.S. COURTS, AT ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TREATIES ON THE PANAMA CANAL, AND AT RESTORING DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE FARCICAL MAY-L989 ELECTIONS. THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR THE U.S. ARMED INTERVENTION IN PANAMA, WHICH IS FILLING THE WORLD WITH TREPIDATION DUE TO THE DANGER HOVERING OVER THE CONTINENT AND THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION HAS GONE BEYOND THE LOGIC OF THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD LATIN AMERICA. INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS DID, HOWEVER, GUESS THAT SOMETHING WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH SAID RECENTLY THAT WHILE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD REACH AGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA, WITH NORIEGA IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH ANY AGREEMENT, AND THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS VEILED DANGER THAT THREATENED THE AMERICAN CONTINENT. TODAY, PANAMA HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD. THE CAPITAL AND OTHER CITIES ARE BATTLEFIELDS ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE FIGHTING THE U.S. UNITS IN GROUND, AIR, AND MARITIME OPERATIONS THAT SEEK TO OUST MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA. THE U.S. ACTION IS FOCUSSING THE WORLD'S ATTENTION ON WASHINGTON'S DECISION. MANY NATIONS WILL PROTEST AND REJECT THE U.S. INVASION WHICH WAS DISGUISED BY A SERIES OF PEACE-SEEKING ACTIONS. FOUR DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE, THE GHOST OF WAR IS HAUNTING OUR CONTINENT. WE MUST PONDER ON THE NEED TO KEEP HONDURAS ON THE DEMOCRATIC PATH, AND TO AVOID THE ANARCHY THAT DESTROYS NATIONS AND DECIMATES PEOPLES. THE EVENTS THAT HAVE KEPT THE WORLD IN VIGIL SINCE MIDNIGHT WILL CONTINUE FOR HOURS, DAYS, OR MAYBE WEEKS BECAUSE, SO FAR, THE NEWS IS VERY CONFUSING AND CIVILIAN VICTIMS ARE DYING ON THE STREETS OF THE PANAMANIAN TOWNS.",

(SANCHO) WE HAVE STATED AND WE HAVE PUT IT IN WRITING -- IT IS GOOD TO HAVE IT IN WRITING -- THAT THE LEFT BECAME DIVIDED AND THE ERP BECAME DIVIDED BECAUSE WE WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH, POLITICALLY AND IDEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ERP LEADERSHIP ACTED CHILDISHLY (WORDS INDISTINCT), BUT WE CAN NOW SAY THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED MATURITY IN EVERY SECTOR.

THIS HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN (WORD INDISTINCT) AND MISCONSTRUED BY THE ENEMY IN ITS PROPAGANDA AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR, BECAUSE IT LOVES TO SAY THAT REVOLUTIONARIES ALWAYS END UP KILLING EACH OTHER.

THEREFORE, THE GENERAL COMMAND NEEDS (WORDS INDISTINCT) SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, MEANING THE NEED FOR THE GENERAL COMMAND MEMBERS TO GO PUBLIC.

IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE WORLD TO KNOW ABOUT THE LEADERS' PERSONALITIES AS THEY ARE. THIS HAS BEEN -- LET US CALL IT A DEFECT OR LIMITATION.

        "text": "WE NOW HAVE COLONEL SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ ON THE TELEPHONE. THE ARMED FORCES, PARTICULARLY THE COMMANDERS OF THE VARIOUS ARMY BRANCHES AND GARRISONS WHO WERE CONVENED BY THE DEFENSE MINISTER, MADE A STATEMENT AGAINST THIS OFFICER, WHO IS A DEPUTY AND THE CURRENT CEL (LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION) PRESIDENT, AFTER HE DEMANDED JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUIT PRIESTS. WE WILL NOW LISTEN TO COL OCHOA, WHO WILL MAKE KNOWN HIS STAND SINCE THE ARMED FORCES' STATEMENT WAS RELEASED. (BEGIN RECORDING) (REPORTER) GOOD MORNING, COLONEL. (OCHOA) GOOD MORNING. THANKS, RAUL. THESE GENTLEMEN SEEM TO BE SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF THE ENTIRE ARMED FORCES. I KNOW WELL WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE MEETING. SOMEONE EVEN SAID THAT THE BRIGHT IDEA OF DISCHARGING ME WAS CONSIDERED. THEY FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, HOWEVER, THAT I AM A DEPUTY AND THAT, AS A DEPUTY AND A CITIZEN, I AM ENTITLED TO EXPRESS WHAT I FEEL, JUST AS I HAVE DONE. I, WHO OWE EVERYTHING TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHO FOUGHT BESIDE THE SOLDIERS AS MONTERROSA, CARLITOS, AND VERY FEW OTHERS DID, NEVER GOT RICH WHEN IN THE ARMED FORCES, AS SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THEM, OF COURSE. THIS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IRRITATED THEM. I HAVE SIMPLY EXPRESSED MY VIEWPOINT AS A SOLDIER CONCERNED ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES' SITUATION. I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES. I SIMPLY DEMANDED JUSTICE BECAUSE, EVEN ACCORDING TO MILITARY THEORY, I CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY A SINGLE PERSON. I STILL THINK THIS IS A PLOT BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION, NOT BY THE ARMED FORCES AS SUCH. I ONLY HAVE RESPECT AND LOVE FOR THE ARMED FORCES. I AM CONCERNED OVER THE DELICATE SITUATION TO WHICH THE INSTITUTION COULD BE LED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF SOME NEFARIOUS MEMBERS. I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR THE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD, WHO FIGHT EVERY DAY. OF COURSE, I MUST CRITICIZE THOSE WHO HAVE PROFITED FROM THE INSTITUTION AND WHO TODAY HAVE RAISED THE ROOF, AS IF I WERE THE ONE TO BLAME AND AS IF I WERE UNDERMINING THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE. QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. MY CRITICISM IS POSITIVE AND INTENDS TO ENCOURAGE A DEEPER INVESTIGATION AND EXHAUST ALL RESOURCES IN THIS DIRECTION. I WOULD LIKE THEM TO STOP MAKING RIDICULOUS DEMANDS AND TO STOP SEEKING A CONFRONTATION. IT IS KNOWN THAT WHAT I AM DEMANDING IS WHAT IS BEING FELT AND SAID. I AM NOT ACCUSING ANYONE IN PARTICULAR. I AM ONLY DEMANDING JUSTICE. COMMANDERS' MEETINGS SHOULD NOT BE HELD TO MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT. THEY SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD SHOWN THEIR CONCERN OVER THE ARMED FORCES' SITUATION. I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING THEM TAKE THE STAND TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO THE LAST CONSEQUENCES. AS THE MILITARY MAN I AM, I ONLY ASSESSED THE SITUATION. I NEVER MENTIONED ANY NAMES, BUT INSISTED THAT A DEEPER INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO CARRY OUT JUSTICE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT IS THE INSTITUTION THAT WILL SUFFER. (REPORTER) COL OCHOA, AFTER THE \"SIXTY MINUTES\" PROGRAM ON CBS IN THE UNITED STATES, IT SEEMS THAT IN THIS CAPITAL AND IN THE COUNTRY YOUR REMARKS AND YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE JESUITS' CASE WERE DISTORTED. TODAY THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO ACCUSE YOU. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE CUT IN U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES IS THE RESULT OF YOUR REMARKS, RATHER THAN OF THE SLOWNESS IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE JEUSIT PRIESTS' CASE. DO YOU THINK THERE HAS BEEN ILL INTENT IN THIS, OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU TO TRY TO JUSTIFY AN ACTION? (OCHOA) I THINK SO. THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO BLAME ME, AS IF I COULD INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE U.S. CONGRESS. A REDUCTION IN MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS BECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN OBTAINED. I THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS AND CHILDISH TO SAY THAT THE AID WILL BE CUT AS THE RESULT OF MY REMARKS. THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL CRIMES WITH WHICH SOME ARMED FORCES' MEMBERS HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE INSTITUTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOLIDARITY SHOULD EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OF OPERATIONS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES' CONSTITUTIONAL MISSION. HOWEVER, THOSE WHO HARM THE INSTITUTION SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTED. I THINK SOME ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION, AS IF TO SAY: COL OCHOA HAS ENDANGERED THE ARMED FORCES. WHAT HAS ENDANGERED THE INSTITUTION IS THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS AND THE SAN SEBASTIAN PEOPLE. I CANOT AGREE WITH THE PERPETRATION OF OUTRAGES. ONE THING IS TO FIGHT FAIRLY WITH THE ENEMY. THERE ARE DEAD IN EVERY WAR. I SAID THIS VERY CLEARLY WHEN I WAS 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMANDER IN CABANAS. I AGREED WITH THE PENETRATION INTO THE POPULATION TO HELP THEM. I FEEL SATISFIED OVER MY PASSAGE THROUGH THE ARMED FORCES AS A COMMANDER, BECAUSE I IDENTIFIED MYSELF BOTH WITH MY MEN AND THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. AT NO TIME DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INSTITUTION TO ACQUIRE ILLEGAL RICHES. TO POINT THESE THINGS OUT IS NOT TO ATTACK THE ARMED FORCES. QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS BECAUSE I LOVE IT THAT I HAVE CRITICIZED THE NEGATIVE MEMBERS. THE ARMED FORCES CAN THUS BE SPARED GREATER DAMAGE BY THE POOR ACTIONS OF SOME OF ITS MEMBERS. (REPORTER) COLONEL, IN THE PAST FEW HOURS WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS THAT YOU ARE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE ARMY'S YOUNGER OFFICERS AND SOME UNIONS, EVEN THE CEL UNION. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THIS SITUATION? (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE A FEW HOURS AGO DENYING THAT IT DIRECTED AN ATTACK AGAINST SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT MAURICIO GUTIERREZ CASTRO. THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE READS: ON THE AFTERNOON OF 2 JULY, FMLN GUERRILLAS CARRIED OUT PROPAGANDA ACTIVITY AND OCCUPIED 8 KM OF THE ROAD TO LA LIBERTAD PORT, BETWEEN THE 14- AND 21-KM MARKERS, WHERE THEY ERECTED A BARRICADE. THE GUERRILLAS ADDED THAT THEY STOPPED APPROXIMATELY 200 VEHICLES TO MEET AND EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH THE DRIVERS. AT THE 14-KM MARKER, A VEHICLE IN WHICH (ROBERTO MATIS REGALADO'S) BODYGUARDS WERE RIDING ARRIVED, BUT THE DRIVER DID NOT OBEY THE ORDER TO STOP, WHICH PROVOKED A CLASH WITH OUR UNITS. TWO MEN WERE WOUNDED AND ONE WOMAN WAS KILLED AS A RESULT OF THAT INCIDENT. OUR FORCES REPORTED THAT THEY SEIZED ONE M-16 RIFLE AND ONE .45 - CALIBER PISTOL. THE FMLN DOCUMENT ADDS THAT MINUTES LATER, AT THE 21-KM MARKER, THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PRESIDENT'S BODYGUARDS TRIED TO SURPRISE OUR FIGHTERS AND ANOTHER CLASH OCCURRED. DURING THE CLASH, ONE BODYGUARD WAS KILLED AND THE ARENA (NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE) OFFICIAL WAS WOUNDED. PARAGRAPH THREE OF THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS THAT THE ARMED PROPAGANDA ACTIVITIES ALONG THE LA LIBERTAD PORT - SAN SALVADOR ROUTE ARE AIMED AT DISTRIBUTING PROPAGANDA AND AT DESTABILIZING THIS VITAL ROUTE USED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND MILITARY MEN TO TRAVEL TO THEIR PRIVATE CLUBS LOCATED ALONG THE COAST. THE FMLN, THE DOCUMENT ADDS, REITERATES ITS DETERMINATION TO STOP THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE GENOCIDAL WAR -- THOSE WHO EVERY DAY SHELL THE RURAL AREAS AND PERSECUTE AND MURDER PEASANTS, WORKERS, AND STUDENTS -- FROM TAKING IT EASY AND RELAXING AT THEIR CLUBS AND IN THEIR EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS. THE ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL POLICE STATION AT THE MANUEL JOSE ARCE MILITARY NEIGHBORHOOD FOLLOWS THIS SAME LINE OF DESTABILIZATION. THEREFORE, WE CALL ON OUR PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ORDERS ISSUED BY OUR FIGHTERS AND TO THEREBY PREVENT REGRETTABLE LOSSES. WE WARN BODYGUARDS AND SECURITY GUARDS THAT WE WILL FIGHT THOSE WHO ARE ARMED AND WHO OFFER RESISTANCE. IN CONCLUSION, THE FMLN COMMUNIQUE RELEASED A FEW HOURS AGO ADDS: WE REITERATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ABIDE BY OUR REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES AND STICK TO THE TRUTH. WE DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN INCIDENTS SUCH AS THE ATTACK AGAINST (PRESIDENCY MINISTER) ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ PORTH AND EDGAR CHACON (IDEOLOGUE OF THE ORLANDO DE SOLA GROUP). THESE INCIDENTS RESULTED FROM A WAR WITHIN ARENA RANKS, AND WE WARN THAT ACTS OF REPRESSION UNLEASHED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE POPULAR AND DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED AND WILL RECEIVE A STRONG RESPONSE FROM OUR FORCES. THIS WAS THE RECENT FMLN COMMUNIQUE ON THE INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED ON 2 JULY ON THE ROAD TO LA LIBERTAD PORT, WHERE THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE WAS WOUNDED.",

HOWEVER, THERE ARE QUITE RELIABLE REPORTS THAT THEY (THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS) HAVE MORE LIKELY FLED TO OTHER COUNTRIES.\" THE MINISTER REVEALED THAT A FINANCING COMPANY, WHICH HE DID NOT IDENTIFY, WAS CLOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND TO BE LAUNDERING DOLLARS OBTAINED FROM THE TRAFFICKING. \"THERE WILL BE NO MERCY IN SUCH CASES,\" HE SAID. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, PRESS REPORTS MENTIONED ECUADOR AS ONE OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE TOP LEADERS OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL HAD REPORTEDLY TAKEN REFUGE TO ESCAPE THE ACTIONS LAUNCHED BY THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING A SERIES OF ASSASSINATIONS COMMITTED BY THE DRUG MAFIAS. EARLY THIS WEEK, ECUADOR REINFORCED ITS EXTENSIVE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA TO KEEP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS OUT. ASSESSING THE STATUS OF DRUGS IN ECUADOR, THE MINISTER ADMITTED THAT \"SEVERAL LARGE ESTATES HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY PEOPLE WHO APPEAR TO BE LINKED TO THE DRUG TRAFFIC.\" HOWEVER, HE EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THESE PURCHASES WERE LINKED TO MONEY LAUNDERING RATHER THAN THE PRODUCTION OF DRUGS. VALLEJO ALSO SAID THAT ECUADOR HAS \"SEVERELY\" RESTRICTED IMPORTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES USED IN THE PRELIMINARY PHASES OF THE REFINING OF NARCOTICS. FORMER FREE ACCESS TO THOSE SUBSTANCES HAD BEEN CONVERTING THE COUNTRY INTO AN ALTERNATIVE BASE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT OF DRUGS TO THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE.",

THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AND ALL HAVE A FAVORABLE BALANCE. WHY NOT ALLOW CITIZENS TO FREELY AND SPONTANEOUSLY EXCERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AGAIN. THIS WOULD CONTINUE THE DEMOCRATIZATION AND DECENTRALIZATION PROCESS NEEDED BY THE COUNTRY TO PROGRESS AND FIND PEACE. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WONDERFUL SERVICES RENDERED BY DR. RAFAEL PARDO, THE NATIONAL REHABILITATION PLAN DIRECTOR, TO ATTEMPT TO FIND NEW ROADS TOWARD ACHIEVING DIALOGUE WITH THESE TWO SECTORS, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ELN. IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND PEACE, ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DEPARTMENT. WE MUST AT LEAST MAKE ATTEMPTS TO HOLD DIALOGUE WITH THIS GUERRILLA GROUP, WHICH HAS SHOWN IT CAN EASILY MOVE AROUND AND DISRUPT STABILITY AND PUBLIC ORDER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF NORTH SANTANDER. (REPORTER) MR. GOVERNOR, UP TO NOW, HAVE ELN OR EPL SUBVERSIVES TRIED TO ATTAIN THIS DIALOGUE? (ASSAF) WELL, NO. IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY, BESIDES WE BELIEVE THESE ARE INITIATIVES THAT SHOULD BE STARTED BY THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS, AS THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE IN SUCH CONVERSATIONS, CONTACTS, AND DIALOGUES. THAT IS WHY I MENTIONED THAT, PERHAPS, THROUGH DR. RAFAEL PARDO, WHO HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S DELEGATE, ATTEMPTS WILL BE MADE TO SEARCH FOR SUCH POSSIBILITIES. I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MAKING EFFORTS TO ATTAIN PEACE IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE QUICKER WE ATTAIN THIS, THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF COLOMBIA. (REPORTER) HAVE YOU ALREADY SENT AN INVITATION OR ASKED DR. RAFAEL PARDO TO COME TO YOUR DEPARTMENT? (ASSAF) WE HAVE TALKED TO HIM OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION AND OTHER SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL ATTENTION. HOWEVER, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT DR. PARDO HAS BEEN WORKING VIRTUALLY FULL-TIME TO FURTHER THE PEACE CONVERSATIONS WITH M-19. THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PLEASED AND VERY HAPPY WITH THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT INITIATION FOR PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S PEACE PROCESS. (REPORTER) BUT DR. RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA DOES NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA OF HOLDING SUCH CONVERSATIONS? (ASSAF) I AM SURE HE DOES NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS FOR A LONG TIME. (REPORTER) WHEN COULD THESE CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE? JUST GIVE US A TENTATIVE DATE. COULD IT BE WITHIN DAYS OR THIS WEEK? (ASSAF) SURELY THIS WEEK WE WILL AGAIN HAVE TO STUDY THE PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND SURELY WE WILL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE THIS PROPOSAL AGAIN AND I BELIEVE DR. PARDO WILL SERIOUSLY TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT. (REPORTER) SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LEADERS -- NOT ONLY IN NORTHERN SANTANDER, BUT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSTANT RAIDS BY SUBVERSIVE GROUPS, AND THEIR MURDERED MAYORS, OFFICIALS, AND POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE KIDNAPPING OF NATIONAL CIVIL REGISTRY OFFICE PERSONNEL. THEY INDICATE THAT WITH ACTIONS OF THIS TYPE IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO FREELY EXPRESS THEMSELVES BY VOTING IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS. (ASSAF) YES, SURELY ALL THESE INCIDENTS CAN, IN A CERTAIN MANNER, WEAKEN THE ELECTORAL VOTE. HOWEVER, EVERYDAY WE ARE MORE CONVINCED THAT COLOMBIANS WANT TO EXCERCISE THIS RIGHT WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF LIMITATIONS AND MAKE EFFORTS -- INCLUDING HEROIC ACTIONS -- TO CONTINUE THIS CAMPAIGN SO THAT ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. VOTING IS THE REAL EXPRESSION OF DEMOCRACY AND WE WILL ALL FIGHT FOR IT. WE ARE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE ARMED FORCES, WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS TO BE HELD WITHOUT PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, IT IS A HUGE EFFORT, AS IT HAS TO CONFRONT A SERIES OF APPREHENSIONS OR FEARS THAT HAVE BEEN INSTILLED IN SOME PEOPLE. (CONTINUED)",

MANY CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AND MANY HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE HAS BEEN NO RESPECT WHATSOEVER -- PERHAPS BECAUSE THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE LOCATED CLOSEST TO THE 3D INFANTRY BRIGADE, AND THAT SEEMS TO WORRY THIS MAN VERY MUCH. THIS COULD BE THE REASON FOR SUCH AN ATTITUDE AND FOR THAT GENOCIDAL SITUATION. IN OTHER PLACES, CLASHES OCCURRED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY LONG ON 12 AND 13 NOVEMBER, AND DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF 14 NOVEMBER IN THE MILAGRO DE LA PAZ NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE WE CAUSED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES. IN ADDITION, OUR FORCES FOILED AND STOPPED THE ARCE BATTALION, PONCE BATTALION, LEON BATTALION, AND THE MONTERROSA FORCES (78-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION) SURVEILLANCE AND SECURITY MEASURES, AND TO HANDLE ANY TYPE OF EMERGENCY, INCLUDING BOMBINGS, MORTAR ATTACKS, AND STRAFINGS. THIS MEANS THAT THE TERRAIN MUST BE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE POPULATION. WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF INSTRUCTION REGARDING THE TASKS TO BE DONE DURING TIMES OF COMBAT, BUT THIS IS GEARED TOWARD THE POPULATION WHO DECIDES TO PARTICIPATE BY DIRECTLY SUPPORTING THE FMLN. THIS INVOLVES MANY PEOPLE. THEY CAN JOIN NEW FORCES AND GROUPS IN CHARGE OF THE TRENCHES, SECURITY MEASURES, COURIERS, AND ALL KINDS OF TASKS TO SUPPORT THE WAR. IN SUM, THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE POPULATION ARE TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES BECAUSE, ONCE ORGANIZED, THEY CAN GIVE (4-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION) AND COUNTER IT. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE CALLS TO THE POPULATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRUGGLE AND ABOVE ALL (7-SECOND BREAK IN RECEPTION) NOT TO LET ANYONE INTIMIDATE THEM. THEY SHOULD NOT LET ANYONE STOP THEM FROM GOING OUT TO PURCHASE THEIR FOOD AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY NEED. GIVEN THE EMERGENCY SITUATION AND THE SHORTAGE OF MEDICINE AND FOOD, WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PEOPLE OF SAN MIGUEL TO OPEN THE STORES WHERE THEY CAN GET FOOD, MEDICINE, AND ANY OTHER ITEMS WHICH ARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR THEIR (WORD INDISTINCT) AND SURVIVAL. THAT IS ALL FOR NOW. GREETINGS TO THE COMRADES WHO ARE LISTENING IN THE CAPITAL, ALL THE COMRADE FIGHTERS, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL. THEIR HIGH MORALE AND ACTIVE ROLE IN THE CAPITAL MAKES US FEEL PROUD. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE VICTORY IS GUARANTEED. WE ARE PREPARED TO DO LIKEWISE AND WE SEND THEM THE COURAGEOUS, FRATERNAL, AND REVOLUTIONARY GREETINGS FROM ALL THE COMMANDERS AND FIGHTERS IN SAN MIGUEL.",

        "text": "GOOD EVENING. THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN IS NOW UNDER WAY. TEN CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF LIMA. WE MUST PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE ELECTORAL ATMOSPHERE THAT PREVAILS SHOULD NOT MAKE US FORGET OUR MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR FATHERLAND. THIS THREAT IS TERRORISM WHICH COSTS LIVES, INFLICTS ECONOMIC HARM, FOSTERS INSECURITY, AND CUTS OFF THE POWER THAT WE NEED FOR OUR HOMES AND OUR INDUSTRIES. WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE TERRORISM. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL POLICE ARE TAKING DRASTIC ACTION IN THE HUALLAGA VALLEY AND IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE. THEY ARE ALSO BREAKING UP URBAN TERRORIST CELLS. HOWEVER, WE MUST ALSO ATTACK TERRORISTS THROUGH LEGAL ACTIONS, THROUGH THE MOST DRASTIC AND SEVERE SENTENCES. IRRESPECTIVE OF MILITARY ACTIONS, IF NO SWIFT AND DRASTIC LEGAL PUNISHMENT IS METED, THE TERRORISTS KNOW THAT THEY WILL GO UNPUNISHED. STIMULATED BY THIS THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR CRIMES. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS AWARE OF THIS. MOST PERUVIANS WANT SEVERE, DRASTIC AND EFFECTIVE PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISTS. THUS, ON 28 JULY I PROPOSED TO THE NATIONAL CONGRESS THAT THE MILITARY COURTS SHOULD TRY TERRORISTS. TONIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THIS SUBJECT BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT IT MAY REMAIN JUST THAT; A PROPOSAL. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK ALL PERUVIANS, ALL ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS, TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS. BY HAVING TERRORISTS TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY CIVILIAN PREROGATIVES. WE ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS. THIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OTHER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. FURTHERMORE, THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF PERU'S DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT THE BATTLE AGAINST SUBVERSION. NO ONE CAN SAY THAT SETTING UP MILITARY COURTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO MILITARIZING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT WOULD IMPLY DISTRUSTING THE ARMED FORCES, OFFENDING THEM AND OVERLOOKING THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DEFENDING DEMOCRACY. MORE THAN 2 YEARS AGO WE ASKED FOR AND WERE ALLOWED TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL COURTS TO TERRORIST CASES. SO FAR THESE COURTS HAVE YIELDED NO POSITIVE RESULTS. THUS, AS PRESIDENT IT IS MY DUTY TO CALL FOR SEVERE SENTENCES, ISSUED WITHOUT DELAY OR ANY THEORETICAL OR ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS. FOLLOWING MY 28 JULY SPEECH I ASCERTAINED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PERUVIANS ARE IN FAVOR OF DRASTIC PUNISHMENTS AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY COURTS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME LEGAL OBJECTIONS AND THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS MEASURE. THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT THE MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS SAY THAT ARTICLE 282 OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW IT. THIS IS HALF TRUE. ARTICLE 282 STATES: IN CASES OF CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE ON DUTY, POLICE AND ARMED FORCES MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY JURISDICTION AND TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE WHICH IS NOT APPLICABLE TO CIVILIANS EXCEPT IN THE CASE DESCRIBED BY ARTICLE 235, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE APPLICATION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE IN CASE OF BETRAYAL OF THE MOTHERLAND DURING WAR. NOW, THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT MILITARY COURTS TO TRY TERRORISTS DO NOT WANT TO READ THE SECOND PART OF ARTICLE 282 WHICH STATES: THOSE WHO AVOID COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO THE MILITARY CODE OF JUSTICE. THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE ONE THAT LEGALLY AND CONSTITUTIONALLY ALLOWS US TO TRY TERRORISTS UNDER THE MILITARY JURISDICTION, BECAUSE TERRORISTS ALSO VIOLATE THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW WHEN THEY COMMIT CRIMES. MANY PERUVIANS WRONGFULLY THINK THAT THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE ONLY AFFECTS MEN ON ACTIVE SERVICE, LIKE THOSE PERUVIANS WHO, AFTER A SELECTION ARE SENT TO SERVE IN A MILITARY GARRISON FOR 1 OR 2 YEARS. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ONE COMPLIES WITH THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE. THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW STATES IN ARTICLE 2: THE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IN AN UNAVOIDABLE DUTY OF ALL PERUVIANS WHO MUST PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL DEFENSE BY COMPLYING WITH THEIR MILITARY OBLIGATIONS.

BESIDES BUSTILLO, WHO WILL BE REPLACED THIS WEEK BY GEN RAFAEL VILLAMARIONA, OTHER MINOR CHANGES AT SEVERAL MILITARY GARRISONS WERE ANNOUNCED. DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, CRISTIANI REFUSED TO COMMENT ON GEN BUSTILLO'S STATEMENTS, WHO THIS WEEK WARNED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES \"NOT TO BE TRICKED BY GUERRILLA LEADERS\" WHO WANTED TO ATTAIN A QUOTA OF POWER THROUGH THE DIALOGUE. BUSTILLO, WHO BECAME CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCE AFTER A COUP D'ETAT UNSEATED PRESIDENT CARLOS HUMBERTO ROMERO ON 15 OCTOBER 1979, ALSO ACCUSED SAN SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS AND AUXILIARY BISHOP GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ OF BEING \"BAD RELIGIOUS OFFICIALS\" AND PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE GUERRILLAS. THERE ARE COMMENTARIES CIRCULATING IN POLITICAL CIRCLES ABOUT A \"CLEAR DIVISION\" AMONG HARDLINE MILITARY OFFICERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHO ARE PART OF THE LA TANDONA (MEMBERS OF THE 1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPTAIN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY) GROUP. THESE OFFICER ARE AGAINST REACHING A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT AND TALKS WITH THE REBELS. OBSERVERS AGREE THAT GEN BUSTILLO'S DISCHARGE WAS PROMPTED BY THE AIR FORCE BOMBING OF LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN SALVADOR DURING THE RECENT GENERAL OFFENSIVE BY THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT). THESE STATEMENTS WERE DENIED BY PRESIDENT CRISTIANI WHO INSISTED THAT BUSTILLO'S DISCHARGE WAS SIMPLY A ROUTINE MOVE WITHIN THE MILITARY INSTITUTION.",

        "text": "ACCORDING TO SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, THE GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED REPORTS, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS DISTURBING, THAT THE REBELS ARE PLANNING TO UNLEASH AN OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL CITY ON THE VERY DAY WHEN PEACE TALKS ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN COSTA RICA. GOVERNMENT REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE INSURGENTS WILL NOT ONLY STEP UP THEIR ACTIONS TO DESTROY THE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND MURDER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, BUT ALSO THREATEN TO USE GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES AGAINST THE CITY. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) ALTHOUGH THE PEACE PROCESS IS UNDER WAY, WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS THAT THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) COMMAND HAS AUTHORIZED A PLAN TO STEP UP VIOLENCE IN SAN SALVADOR THROUGH THE USE OF GROUND-TO-AIR MISSILES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOWS ABSOLUTELY NO WILLINGNESS TO BRING ABOUT PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. THE MEDIA SHOULD REVEAL TO ALL SALVADORANS AND THE ENTIRE WORLD WHAT THE FMLN IS PLANNING TO DO. (END RECORDING) ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT, THESE FMLN PLANS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER IN MEXICO. WHEN ASKED WHETHER THESE ACTIONS PLANNED BY THE FMLN COULD HARM THE TALKS IN COSTA RICA, CRISTIANI SAID THAT THIS WILL DEPEND ON THE SITUATION THAT PREVAILS AT THE MEETING. HE ADDED THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT OPPOSES THE USE OF THE TALKS FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) IF THE FMLN WANTS TO USE THE PROCESS FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES, WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO THEIR GAME. OUR OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO SEEK PEACE IN GOOD WILL. HOWEVER, I REPEAT, WE WILL NOT LEND OURSELVES TO A FMLN TACTICAL GAME. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS AT THIS MOMENT. THE OUTCOME WILL DEPEND ON THESE ALLEGED PLANS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN COSTA RICA. (END RECORDING) AN END TO THE HOSTILITIES WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS ROUND OF TALKS. THUS, THIS MEETING COULD BE CRUCIAL FOR ACHIEVING NATIONAL PEACE. CRISTIANI MAINTAINED THAT THIS MEETING WILL BE USEFUL TO GAUGE THE INTENTIONS OF THE GUERRILLA FRONT. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) WE WILL PRESENT A GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL. IT IS AN BROAD PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH VARIOUS ISSUES, EVEN THE POSSIBLE INCORPORATION OF THE FMLN TO CIVILIAN AND DEMOCRATIC LIFE. IT SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH AN END TO THE HOSTILITIES, A TOPIC THAT WE HAD AGREED TO ADDRESS IN COSTA RICA DURING OUR MEETING IN MEXICO. WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC THAT IS WITHIN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE SAKE OF DEMOCRACY. (END RECORDING) THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED AS BENEFICIAL THE UN AND OAS PRESENCE AT THE TALKS, BECAUSE THEY WILL GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN COSTA RICA. ONLY A DAY BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN, THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT DESPITE AN INCREASE IN WAR ACTIONS, THE MEETING IN COSTA RICA WILL NOT FACE OBSTACLES.",

THE PRESIDENT HAS ORDERED 3 DAYS OF NATIONAL MOURNING IN HONOR OF THE SLAIN MINISTER. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) WE ARE GOING TO RESPOND LEGALLY. WE WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE REQUISITE EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATIONS TO FIND AND PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR A CRIME AGAINST THE LIFE OF AN EXEMPLARY CITIZEN. (END RECORDING) PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI BLAMED THE FMLN FOR MINISTER RODRIGUEZ PORTH'S DEATH. HE SAID THIS ATTACK IS PART OF A SERIES OF ACTIONS AIMED AT DESTABILIZING THE NEW GOVERNMENT. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) WE ARE VIRTUALLY CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS AN FMLN EFFORT, AN FMLN INCIDENT, TO TRY AND PROVOKE A REACTION FROM OUR GOVERNMENT. WE FEEL THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SHOW US WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT; HOWEVER, I REPEAT WE ARE ALMOST SURE THAT THIS WAS DONE BY THE FMLN. WE HAD HOPED THE FMLN WOULD REFRAIN FROM THIS TYPE OF BARBARIC ACTION; HOWEVER, IT IS THE DUTY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY CORPS TO OFFER PROTECTION. THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED: TO OFFER GREATER SAFETY AND PROTECTION TO THE PEOPLE. (END RECORDING) DURING THIS EVENING'S RADIO VENCEREMOS NEWSCAST, HOWEVER, THE REBELS NEITHER CLAIMED NOR DENIED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK. NEVERTHELESS, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THE ASSASSINATION MAY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN IN AN ATTEMPT TO HINDER THE DIALOGUE. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) WE HAD LEARNED, EVEN BEFORE THE INAUGURATION, THAT THE FMLN WOULD TRY TO HINDER THE TRANSITION FROM ONE GOVERNMENT TO ANOTHER AND LATER CREATE ANARCHIC SITUATIONS FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT. THIS COULD BE PART OF THAT PLAN. I ALSO FEEL THAT THIS COULD BE THE FMLN'S WAY TO FORCE US TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. IT WOULD BE REGRETTABLE THAT AFTER RECEIVING A FORMAL OFFER TO SIT DOWN TO TALK -- FIRST ABOUT THE MECHANISMS TO BE USED AS GUIDELINES DURING THE TALKS AND LATER TO BROACH THE MAIN ISSUES IN AN ATTEMPT TO REACH A LASTING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY -- THE FMLN SHOULD STILL THINK THAT SUCH ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY. I THINK THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO DISRUPT THE NEW GOVERNMENT'S WORK. (END RECORDING) DURING THIS EVENING'S NEWS CONFERENCE, PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT DURING TODAY'S CABINET MEETING IT WAS DECIDED TO ASK THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO DECREE 3 DAYS OF MOURNING FOR DR RODRIGUEZ PORTH.",

I HAVE, DEEP IN MY THOUGHTS, MY CAMPAIGN COMPANIONS, MY DEBATE LEADERS, ALL THOSE WHO FILLED EVERY MOMENT WITH DEDICATION AND ENTHUSIASM, WHICH I HOPE TO DESERVE. I HAVE PRESENT THE UNIVERSITY YOUTH, STAUNCH STANDARD-BEARERS OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY (APPLAUSE); ALL OF MY PARTY LEADERS, SERVANTS OF THE LIBERAL CAUSE WHO SHOWED STEADFAST LOYALTY; GRASSROOTS LEADERS FROM ALL PARTS OF COLOMBIA; AND THE PEOPLE, WHOSE DECISION COMMITS ME BEYOND ANY DOUBT. I WANT TO OFFER THIS VICTORY TO GLORIA, JUAN MANUEL, AND HIS BROTHERS (APPLAUSE), AND TO LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S PARENTS -- MARIO AND CECILIA -- WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM IN HIS LONG HEROIC JOURNEY THROUGH COLOMBIAN LIFE. THIS IS HIS VICTORY, A VICTORY FOR HIS CHILDREN, HIS IDEALS, HIS FAITH IN COLOMBIA, AND THE LIBERAL PRINCIPLES THAT INSPIRED HIS LIFE. I ALSO THINK OF MY MOTHER; MY BROTHERS; ANA MILENA (APPLAUSE), MY WIFE AND COMPANION AT ALL TIMES AND DURING SLEEPLESS NIGHTS; AND MY CHILDREN SIMON AND MARIA PAZ. (APPLAUSE) TODAY COLOMBIA HAS COMPLETED THE MOST DIFFICULT AND RUGGED POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN ALL ITS HISTORY. ITS VALUES, ITS DEMOCRACY, AND ITS LIBERTY WERE AT STAKE AS NEVER BEFORE. AS NEVER BEFORE, THE PROMOTERS OF VIOLENCE FROM ALL SIDES TRIED TO DESTABILIZE OUR INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, COLOMBIANS, ALSO AS NEVER BEFORE, STOOD UP TO THE HISTORIC MOMENT WE FACED. THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE'S POWERFUL DEMOCRATIC DETERMINATION WAS STRONGER. CONVINCED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CURRENT HOUR, THEY WENT OUT TO SUPPORT WITH MILLIONS OF VOTES DEMOCRACY THAT HAS HAD TO FACE BOMBS, NARCOTERRORISM, AND HATEFUL PRACTICES. ALL THOSE WHO HAVE WANTED TO THREATEN OUR DEMOCRACY MUST LISTEN: OUR PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN TODAY WITH COURAGE AND CLARITY. WE SHALL PREVAIL. IT HAS BEEN A CONSCIENTIOUS, BOLD MOBILIZATION BY MILLIONS OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR POLITICAL WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME THROUGH A SYSTEM WITHOUT PRESSURE OR INTIMIDATION. ONCE AGAIN, TODAY, AS ON 11 MARCH, CITIZENS VOTED AS THEY WISHED. THIS DIFFICULT AND RUGGED CAMPAIGN HAS NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY A CRUDE CONFRONTATION AMONG CANDIDATES, WHO ACTED WITH DECENCY AND LOYALTY. (CONTINUED)",

UP WAS FORMED IN 1984, DURING A TRUCE SIGNED BETWEEN FARC AND THE THEN SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT BELISARIO BETANCUR. ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, PARDO LEAL WAS MURDERED BY TWO PAID ASSASSINS WHO RECEIVED ORDERS FROM \"EL MEXICANO\" ON 11 OCTOBER 1987. RODRIGUEZ GACHA ARGUED: \"NOBODY HAS BEEN CHASED WITH SUCH FIERCENESS IN COLOMBIA BEFORE AS I HAVE.\" HE ADDED: \"IT SEEMS THAT ALL THE ARTICLES OF THE PENAL CODE HAVE BEEN THROWN AT ME AND MY DETRACTORS ARE NOT BINDED BY ANY OF THESE NORMS.\" AFTER HE INSISTED THAT OFFENSIVES AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN ARMED FORCES SHOULD STOP, RODRIGUEZ GACHA NOTED THAT THOSE WHO DISTURB PUBLIC ORDER \"SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP USING WEAPONS.\" \"THESE ARE THE FIRST STEPS THAT ARE NEEDED TO GET COLOMBIANS TO SIT AT A NEGOTIATING TABLE WITHOUT EXCLUDING ANYONE,\" HE CONCLUDED.

ACCORDING TO INITIAL REPORTS, THE ARMED MOVEMENT--THE MOST RADICAL OF THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY--SENT THE MESSAGE THROUGH LUIS MESA PUERTA, A POLICE INSPECTOR OF EL TIGRE, WHO WAS KIDNAPED LAST FRIDAY FOR THIS PURPOSE. ROLDAN BETANCUR DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY MORE DETAILS AND MERELY CONFIRMED THAT THE CASTROITE ELN, WHICH HAS STAGED SEVERAL DYNAMITE ATTACKS AGAINST OIL INSTALLATIONS, DID NOT ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL MADE BY PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS' GOVERNMENT. MEANWHILE, THE M-19 SENT A LETTER A FEW HOURS AGO TO MISAEL PASTRANA BORRERO, A FORMER PRESIDENT AND MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY (PSC), REQUESTING THAT HIS PARTY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN A NEW PEACE INITIATIVE THAT FORMALLY BEGAN THE 2D WEEK OF JANUARY. AT THAT TIME, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, RAFAEL PARDO RUEDA--THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER FOR PEACE--AND THE TOP M-19 COMMANDER, CARLOS PIZARRO LEON GOMEZ, SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THAT CONTEMPLATES THE BEGINNING OF A DIRECT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GUERRILLA GROUPS AND SPOKESMEN OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT. HOWEVER, THE FARC, WHICH DECLARED A UNILATERAL TRUCE TO FACILIATE THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATIONS, SAID THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WERE \"EXCLUSIVE,\" AS THEY WERE SIGNED BY ONLY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S REBEL MOVEMENTS. THE DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE M-19 SPECIFIES THAT THE TASKS WITH ALL THE REBEL ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNGSB). HOWEVER, WITH THE ELN ANNOUNCEMENT, A JOINT AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RULED OUT. MEANWHILE, PRIOR TO LEAVING TODAY FOR CARACAS WHERE HE WILL ATTEND THE INAUGURATION OF CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, THE PRESIDENT HELD A MEETING WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES, FORMER PRESIDENTS JULIO CESAR TURBAY OF THE RULING LIBERAL PARTY, AND PASTRANA BORRERO, OF THE PSC. THE MEETING HELD AT THE NARINO PALACE (SEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT) WAS CALLED SO THAT BARCO VARGAS COULD REPORT TO THE PSC ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOST RECENT EVENTS CONCERNING THE NEW PEACE PROCESS THAT BEGAN WITH THE M-19. ACCORDING TO SOME POLITICAL CIRCLES, IN THIS MANNER THE PATH TOWARD PEACE MIGHT BE CLEARED, INASMUCH AS ONE OF THE \"RESERVATIONS\" THE PSC HAD WAS THAT THE BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE PARTIES ON THE NEGOTIATIONS.",

IT WILL DEMAND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BREAK RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR AND THAT IT TAKE MEASURES AGAINST THAT CRIMINAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT STOPS THE BOMBINGS AND THE CRIMES AND IT PUNISHES THE CRIMINALS. WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IS PEACE AND DEMOCRACY, BUT NOT THE PEACE OF GRAVEYARDS. THERE IS PEACE IN CEMETERIES (WORDS INDISTINCT). THAT IS THE PEACE THEY WANT FOR EL SALVADOR, THE PEACE OF GRAVEYARDS. THEY WANT TO TURN EL SALVADOR INTO A CEMETERY. IN OTHER WORDS, (WORDS INDISTINCT). HOWEVER, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE COURAGEOUS. THEY ARE HEROIC PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWING THIS. THEY HAVE GREAT (WORDS INDISTINCT). WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE STRUGGLING IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE TO ACHIEVE PEACE. IT IS NOT WE NICARAGUANS, IT IS NOT I BREAKING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENTS. I WILL CONTINUE TO DEFEND THEM SO THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL ABIDE BY THEM, BECAUSE HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED. ON 7 AUGUST 1987, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SIGNED AN AGREEMENT SAYING THAT IT WAS GOING TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, AND IT IS NOT ABIDING BY THAT AGREEMENT. IT HAS TO COMPLY WITH THAT AGREEMENT EVEN IF IT WITHDRAWS FROM THE PEACE TALKS, EVEN IF IT DOES NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETINGS OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE STRUGGLING IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE, IN THE UNITED NATIONS, SO THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED TO COMPLY WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS.

ALL THOSE NAMES ARE KNOWN IN THE WORLD FOR THE HEROIC BATTLES WHICH HAVE BEEN WAGED THERE TO REJECT THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES WHO HAVE RECEIVED ALL TYPES OF SUPPORT FROM THE YANKEES. THE YANKEES HAVE GIVEN THE CONTRAS ALL TYPES OF ARMAMENTS, INCLUDING MORE THAN 300 SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES. WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE PEACE BECAUSE THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WANT PEACE. THE TOWNS IN NORTHERN NICARAGUA WANT PEACE. THEY WANT PEACE. DO YOU WANT PEACE? (CROWD SHOUTS: \"YES!\") OR DO YOU WANT WAR? (CROWD SHOUTS: \"NO!\") DO YOU WANT PEACE? (CROWD SHOUTS: \"YES!\") (QUESTION AND ANSWER REPEATED TWO MORE TIMES) WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE PEACE. WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE TOTAL PEACE BY ALWAYS VIGOROUSLY FIGHTING THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES AND DEFEATING THE YANKEES IN THE ELECTIONS ON 25 FEBRUARY 1990.

BUSH IS PAYING THOSE PEOPLE TO BE PRETENDING (WORDS INDISTINCT). THE REAL ENEMY HERE IS THE YANKEES WHO HAVE ORGANIZED AND FINANCED THE UNO. THE YANKEES CANNOT SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THEY CANNOT EVEN SOLVE HONDURAS' PROBLEM. THEY CANNOT SOLVE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS LENT ITSELF FOR THE YANKEE MANEUVERING. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THAT THE HONDURAN PEOPLE ARE COMBATIVE AND BRAVE. WHAT IS THE ARMY USED FOR IN HONDURAS? WHAT IS IT USED FOR? TO MASSACRE THE PEOPLE (PASSAGE INDISTINCT). THE CONTRAS ARE IN HONDURAN TERRITORY. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THOSE CONTRAS OUT? IT IS UP TO THE HONDURANS, IT IS UP TO THE HONDURAN ARMY. (CONTINUED)",

THE (FRELIMO) PARTY IS FOLLOWING THIS PERIOD OF REFLECTION ON THE PROCESS OF THE BUILDING OF SOCIALISM IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND IT IS OVERJOYED BY THE FACT THAT THIS PROCESS CONTINUES TO SAFEGUARD COOPERATION WITH OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE AWARE THAT THESE CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CHANGES THAT ARE OBSERVED IN THE USSR WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF PERESTROYKA AND GLASNOST, HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT AT THE LEVEL OF THE (MARXIST-LENINIST) PARTIES AND THE PROGRESSIVE FORCES, AS WELL AS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN GENERAL.

THEY WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS THE FMLN THAT MUST STOP ITS HOSTILITIES, AND DO SO AT ONCE, IMMEDIATELY, AND EFFECTIVELY IN ORDER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE PRESIDENTS, AS ANY RATIONAL PEOPLE, FEEL IT IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO CONDUCT A PROCESS OF DIALOGUE WITHOUT BOMBS AND BULLETS. WHAT ELSE DOES THE AGREEMENT SAY? IT SAYS THE END OF HOSTILITIES WILL PERMIT A DIALOGUE SO THAT THE FMLN WILL LATER ABANDON THE ARMED STRUGGLE, DISBAND AS AN ARMED GROUP, SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS, AND JOIN DEMOCRATIC AND INSTITUTIONAL LIFE. BY THIS, THEY -- EVEN NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA WHO SIGNED THE AGREEMENT -- MEAN THERE IS INSTITUTIONAL LIFE IN EL SALVADOR AND DEMOCRACY, WHICH THEY ARE ASKING THE FMLN TO JOIN. THIS IS THE SPIRIT OF THE PROPOSAL THE GOVERNMENT TOOK TO SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL WE ADOPTED IS SO LONG, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO READ IT TO YOU, SO THAT YOU CAN BE INFORMED. HOWEVER, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES TOMORROW WHAT I AM SAYING TO YOU TONIGHT, BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL WILL BE PUBLISHED IN ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S NEWSPAPERS. THERE, YOU WILL SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS FAITHFULLY COMPLYING WITH WHAT THE FIVE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS SIGNED IN THE TELA ACCORD, AND THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING UP ON THE TERMS OF THE FIRST DIALOGUE IN MEXICO. WHAT DOES THE FMLN DO IN SAN JOSE? FIRST, DRAWING AWAY FROM THE AGREEMENT MADE IN MEXICO, IT DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT CEASING HOSTILITIES. IT INTRODUCES SEVERAL PROPOSALS, WHICH THE FMLN CLAIMS ARE AN EXPANSION ON THE MEXICO PROPOSAL, AND PRESENTS SEVERAL DOCUMENTS TO THE SALVADORAN DELEGATION. BY THE WAY, THE FMLN ALSO VIOLATES THE MEXICO PACT BY NOT RESPECTING THE DISCRETION OF THE DIALOGUE PROCESS. ONCE AGAIN IT PRESENTS THESE DOCUMENTS TO THE NEWS MEDIA BEFORE PRESENTING THEM TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION. AS YOU WILL SEE, THE DELEGATION RECEIVED QUITE A FEW DOCUMENTS FROM THE FMLN THERE. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "DESPITE AMPLE EVIDENCE, NO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT HAD BLAMED THE ARMED FORCES OF KILLING DEFENSELESS CIVILIANS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR WORSENED IN 1979. THE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE ARREST OF 45 SOLDIERS AND 2 OFFICERS FOR KILLING 6 CLERGYMEN, A MAID, AND HER DAUGHTER, ON 16 NOVEMBER IS IN ITSELF A SMALL AND PARTIAL MILESTONE. CRISTIANI, WHOSE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE PARTY WAS FOUNDED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES BY INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO PARAMILITARY BANDS, THE ARMY, AND SECURITY CORPS, ASSERTED THAT THE NAMES OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. JESUIST FRANCISCO ESTRADA, WHO REPLACED FATHER JOSE IGNACIO ELLACURIA -- ONE OF THOSE MASSACRED -- AT THE RECTORSHIP OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN SAN SALVADOR, WARNED THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW WHICH SARGENT PULLED THE TRIGGER BUT WHO GAVE HIM ORDERS TO DO SO NEEDS TO BE REVEALED. CRISTIANI WILL NOT GO THAT FAR. COSMETIC SACRIFICES ARE MADE IN ORDER TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT OF U.S. CONGRESS INTERRUPTING THE $1.5 MILLION IT SENDS A DAY FOR THE WAR AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AND THE REPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE. THE DISMISSAL OF GENERAL JUAN RAFAEL BUSTILLO AS CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCES AND THE POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT OF SOME OF THE COUNTERINSURGENT ATLACATL BATTALION FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, CRISTIANI WILL ATTEND THE NEXT INFORMAL SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS IN TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS ON 28 JANUARY UNDER ADVERSE CONDITIONS. THE MOBILIZATION OF THE LATIN AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST THE U.S. INTERVENTION IN PANAMA AND ITS AIM OF EXTENDING THE INTERVENTION TO OTHER NATIONS OF THE AREA HAVE WEAKENED WASHINGTON'S DIPLOMATIC SPACE. THIS COULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON ITS POLITICAL ALLY OF EL SALVADOR WHICH, IN THE PREVIOUS SUMMIT HELD IN DECEMBER, PRESENTED NICARAGUA AND THE FMLN AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORSENING OF THE CRISIS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE FACTS ARE CONCLUSIVE. WHAT WILL NOW BE THE EXCUSE OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND HIS PROTECTOR GEORGE BUSH?",

        "text": "TWO U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES -- AGED 19 AND 21 -- WERE SHOT TO DEATH LAST NIGHT BY A GROUP OF TERRORISTS FROM THE ZARATE WILKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION (FAL). THIS IS THE SAME TERRORIST GROUP THAT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE FOILED ATTACK AGAINST FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ IN AUGUST 1988. IN OCTOBER, THE GROUP BLEW UP THE LINES PROVIDING POWER TO LA PAZ, RESULTING IN A POWER OUTAGE THERE. THE GROUP ALSO CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE JANUARY DYNAMITE BOMBING IN THE CONGRESS. THE MURDER TOOK PLACE AT 2220 LAST NIGHT AND, 30 MINUTES LATER, THE TERRORISTS LEFT MESSAGES WITH LOCAL NEWSPAPERS CLAIMING TO BE THE ASSAILANTS. THE MESSAGE, WHICH WAS HANDRITTEN, SAID: \"THE VIOLATION OF OUR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED. THIS IS A WARNING TO THE YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS AND TO THEIR LACKEYS. WE POOR HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO TAKE UP ARMS. OUR HATRED IS IMPLACABLE, AND OUR WAR IS TO THE DEATH. FAL, ZARATE WILKA.\" THE U.S. CITIZENS -- TODD RAY WILSON BURDENSON AND JEFFREY BRENT BALL -- WERE MISSIONARIES OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS (HEADQUARTERED IN UTAH), WHICH, IN RECENT YEARS, HAS EXTENDED ITS ACTIVITIES IN BOLIVIA BY BUILDING DOZENS OF TEMPLES. BOTH MISSIONARIES HAD LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF THE GENERAL CEMETERY LOCATED IN A DENSELY POPULATED LA PAZ DISTRICT. THEY WERE KILLED WITH TWO BURSTS OF MACHINEGUN FIRE. A MORMON CHURCH SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THIS WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST \"TWO INNOCENT PEOPLE\" AND CALLED ON THE POLICE TO SOLVE THE MURDER. HE SAID THAT LAST YEAR DYNAMITE WAS PLACED AT A TEMPLE IN THE SAME AREA BUT THAT THE CULPRITS WERE NEVER IDENTIFIED. THE BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ORDERED AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION. DEPUTY INTERIOR MINISTER WALTER COSTAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRAFFIC AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS WILL CARRY OUT DRAGNETS IN LA PAZ. THE KILLING OF THE U.S. MISSIONARIES HAS COINCIDED WITH THE ARRIVAL IN BOLIVIA OF THE FIRST CONTINGENT OF U.S. MILITARY ENGINEERS, TECHNICIANS, AND TROOPS, WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE TASK OF LEVELING PATTI-PATTI HILL TO BUILD AN AIRPORT FOR THE CITY OF POTOSI.",

TWO OF HER DAS BODYGUARDS, DAGOBERTO RODRIGUEZ AND ALFONSO DE LIMA, WHO WERE INSIDE THE CAR, WERE KILLED INSTANTLY. NO ONE HAS BEEN ARRESTED YET IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INCIDENT. THE TRUTH IS THAT THE MANY THREATS MADE AGAINST HER BECAME A REALITY TODAY. MARIA ELENA DIAZ, 34, WILL BE BURIED IN MEDELLIN TOMORROW.",

THE AGGGRESSIVE SEARCH FOR NEW MARKETS DOES NOT RESPECT OCEANS, JUST AS IT HAS NOT RESPECTED BORDERS. ANYWHERE THERE ARE CONSUMERS, THERE WILL BE SUPPLIERS. IN FACT, COCAINE IS BUT ONE OF THE PERNICIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE CRISIS OF DRUG ABUSE, WHICH IS MUCH BROADER. WE MUST NOT DELUDE OURSELVES. THIS SCOURGE AFFECTS US ALL. ACTING IN SOLIDARITY, AS A COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, WE MUST FOLLOW THIS PLAN OF ACTION: FIRST, IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CURB THE DEMAND FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS. DRUG ABUSE IS THE FUEL THAT PROPELS NARCOTERRORISM. TODAY IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES. COCAINE USERS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE KILLING OF MY PEOPLE BY THE CRIMINAL INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION. WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, IN ANY OF THE DISTINGUISHED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS OF THIS CITY, A HABITUAL COCAINE USER MAY REGARD MY ASSERTION AS AN EXAGGERATION. NEVERTHELESS, HIS VICE MAKES HIM A COLLABORATOR OF THE MURDERERS WHO HAVE KILLED MANY COLOMBIAN JUDGES AND POLICEMEN, WHO HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY AND LAW. (APPLAUSE) NO WEAPON OR TACTIC USED IN THIS STRUGGLE WILL BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH IF IT IS NOT COMBINED WITH RESOLUTE EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND. THE ILLEGAL PROFITS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE. I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL DEFEAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN COLOMBIA, BUT SOMEONE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY, SOMEWHERE, WILL TAKE OVER THIS BUSINESS AS LONG AS IT REMAINS SO PROFITABLE. THIS HAPPENED WITH MARIJUANA. WHEN IT BECAME TOO COSTLY FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PUBLIC FORCES, THE TRADERS IN VICE MOVED THEIR PLANTATIONS TO CALIFORNIA, TO HAWAII, AND TO MANY OTHER REGIONS. THE ONLY LAW THE DRUG RUNNERS DO NOT VIOLATE IS THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND. (APPLAUSE) NO SOCIETY, REGARDLESS OF HOW WEALTHY IT IS, CAN AFFORD THE LUXURY OF ALLOWING ITS SONS OR DAUGHTERS TO POISON THEMSELVES WITH COCAINE, HEROIN, MARIJUANA, OR ANY OTHER SUCH DEADLY DRUGS. IN THIS CONTEXT, I WISH TO ASSERT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO CURB THE DEMAND IS A FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE MUST INSIST ON THE MESSAGE THAT ILLEGAL DRUGS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE OR HARMLESS, WHETHER THEY ARE CONSUMED IN THE GLITTERING PARTIES OF THE RICH OR IN THE SLUMS. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "...NOT ONLY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ANDEAN PACT, BUT ALSO OF THE VAST HORIZONS OF THE CARIBBEAN AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION. AS WE JOIN EFFORTS, AS WE STRENGTHEN OUR CAPABILITIES, AND WITH THE LONG TRADITION OF DEMOCRACY THAT WE SHARE, WE CAN OFFER OUR CONTRIBUTION TO STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY. ALL THE DEMOCRATS OF THE AMERICAS WHO SEE IN YOU, MR. PRESIDENT PEREZ, A GREAT FIGHTER, ARE NOW CELEBRATING A POSITIVE WAVE OF LEGITIMATE ELECTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE IN URUGUAY, CHILE, BRAZIL, COSTA RICA, AND NICARAGUA. VERY SHORTLY COLOMBIA AND LATER PERU WILL HOLD ELECTIONS. PANAMA, IN TURN, HAS CALLED FOR POPULAR CONSULTATION IN THE FORM OF A REFERENDUM SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL DECIDE ON IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, DEMOCRACY IS THE PATH AND THAT IS WHY IT WILL BE THE ADEQUATE MEANS FOR STRENGTHENING THE OAS AS A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION IN WHICH THE VARIOUS TRENDS AND IDEOLOGIES WITHIN A COMMON OBJECTIVE OF SEARCHING FOR PEACE, FREEDOM, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE MAY AND SHOULD BE EXPRESSED AND CONSULTED ON. THERE, THE MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO DISCUSS TOPICS THAT AFFECT US IN A DIRECT MANNER, SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL TRADE, FOREIGN DEBT, AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION, AS WELL AS HOW TO INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ACTION WITH VARIOUS INTERLOCUTORS, SUCH AS THE CASE OF CANADA, THE ENTRY IF WHICH INTO THE OAS WE WARMLY WELCOME. THEREFORE, LET US CONSIDER THE REASONS FOR THIS MEETING WHICH WE DO NOT HESITATE IN TERMING HISTORIC. THE DOCUMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF HOW MUCH WE HAVE ADVANCED IN SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIELDS OF ENERGY, COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION, AND BORDER TRANSIT; IN JOINT PROGRAMS IN CITY PLANNING SUCH AS THE CUCUTA-VILLA EL ROSARIO-SAN ANTONIO-URENA; IN THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECTORS, AND IN INDIAN ETHNIC GROUPS, CUSTOMS, AND EDUCATION. ALL OF THESE ARE TOPICS WE HAVE DISCUSSED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH OUR RESPECTIVE TEAMS. HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE TOPIC THAT I WISH TO EMPHASIZE. THERE IS AN ENEMY WHO SEEKS TO DESTROY THE INTEGRATIONIST AND DEMOCRATIC PROJECT. THERE ARE ANACHRONISTIC REDOUBTS OF A SUBVERSIVE NATURE THAT ARE TODAY ENFENCED BY OUR MILITARY FORCES AND OUR HARD WORKING PEOPLE. THE ENEMY FEELS HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF THOUGH VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION, AND INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM; BY DESTROYING OIL PIPELINES AND CONTAMINATING RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS. OUR COMMISSIONS HAVE SUGGESTED POSITIVE MEANS FOR WORKING JOINTLY ON THESE RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS, AND HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT IS ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED ON OIL SPILLS AND ACCIDENTS. COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL OVER THIS INTERNAL ENEMY, AND UNDOUBTEDLY THE INTEGRATION PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE WITH RENEWED VIGOR. THE TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER RESOUCES, THE ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE INTERCONNECTIONS, THE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR THE VARIOUS ALTERNATE ROUTES THAT WILL CONNECT US, THE REOPENING OF THE BRIDGES THAT WERE CLOSED 30 YEARS AGO, THE UTILIZATION OF THE CAMILO DAZA AIRPORT IN CUCUTA AS AN ALTERNATE AIRPORT FOR SAN ANTONIO, THE AGREEMENT ON FISHING POLICIES, THE PLANS TO INCREASE CROPS RANGING FROM SUGARCANE AND COTTON TO CHIQUI-CHIQUI FIBER ARE POSITIVE ANSWERS TO THOSE WHO INSIST ON DISRUPTING THINGS. THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY TODAY NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT AND THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, BUT ABOVE ALL, IT POINTS TO PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING AND INCREASES THEIR CAPABILITIES FOR CONSUMPTION. IT IS NOT BY BLOWING UP OIL PIPELINES OR PREVENTING THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONG THE RIVER BANKS OF BOTH COUNTRIES FROM FISHING OR BY POISONING THEIR CROPS THAT PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING WILL BE ACHIEVED. I AM SURE THAT THE SAN PEDRO ALEJANDRINO DOCUMENT WE SIGNED TODAY IS A GRADUAL, BUT DECISIVE STEP TOWARD AUTHENTIC LATIN AMERICAN INTEGRATION. BY THE DECISION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND PROMOTED BY THEIR RULERS IN THIS SIMPLE ROOM WHERE THE LIBERATOR DIED, WE ARE TODAY CONSOLIDATING THESE BASES THAT WILL NOT BE DESTROYED AND WILL PREVENT IN THE FUTURE ANY FURTHER FRUSTRATIONS OF THE DREAMS OF THE LIBERATOR, BOLIVAR. MIXED COMMISSIONS WILL BE APPOINTED SHORTLY AND WILL GET DOWN TO WORK IN WHAT WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO. THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH A TRULY LIBERATING TASK, THAT TODAY -- AS FROM THE TIMES OF THE CONGRESS OF ANGOSTURA -- IS UNITING OUR TWO NATIONS. THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE)",

THE ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT LIBERAL PARTY LEADER HAD LEFT HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ANY BODYGUARDS ONLY MINUTES EARLIER. AS HE WAITED FOR THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TO CHANGE, THREE HEAVILY ARMED MEN FORCED HIM TO GET OUT OF HIS CAR AND GET INTO A BLUE RENAULT.

IN THE CALLS, THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL RELEASE THE SENATOR WITH A NEW MESSAGE FOR THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. LAST WEEK, FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ HAD REJECTED TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.",

THE DECLARATION, WHICH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE REQUESTED FROM THE FOURTH PENAL COURT, DID NOT PROVIDE DETAILS REGARDING EVIDENCE THAT COULD BE USED TO SOLVE THE CASE OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO, WHO WAS A STAUNCH CRITIC OF THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ITS ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A LIST OF THE NAMES OF 12 ARMY OFFICERS AND 12 CIVILIANS WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN PLOTTING TO OUST THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT JUNTA THAT TOOK OVER IN OCTOBER 1979 AFTER OVERTHROWING GENERAL HUMBERTO ROMERO. THE LIST OF PLOTTERS INCLUDES RIGHTIST DEPUTY D'AUBUISSON, FOUNDER OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) -- THE WINNER IN THE RECENT ELECTIONS -- AND CAPTAIN ALVARO SARAVIA, WHOM THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED OF BEING THE MASTERMINDS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE CLERGYMAN. THE LIST ALSO INCLUDES THE NAMES OF CIVILIANS INVOLVED IN THE KIDNAPPING OF SEVERAL SALVADORAN BUSINESSMEN EARLY IN THE DECADE. ACCORDING TO DUARTE'S DECLARATION, 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE SOLDIERS ARRESTED THE 24 COUP PLOTTERS IN 1980, AND SEVERAL DOCUMENTS WERE SEIZED FROM THEM, INCLUDING A NOTEBOOK WITH PLANS FOR KILLING ROMERO. THE U.S. SENATE HAS A NOTEBOOK OWNED BY CAPT SARAVIA, AND SALVADORAN JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING HOW THE U.S. SENATE ENDED UP WITH IT. ACCORDING TO DUARTE, \"COLONEL ADOLFO ARNULFO MAJANO, A MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY JUNTA THAT OUSTED GEN ROMERO, HAD THE DOCUMENTS.\" THE SALVADORAN SUPREME COURT RECENTLY REVOKED A SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT EXTRADITION REQUEST FOR SARAVIA, WHOM THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO QUESTION TO HELP SOLVE THE ROMERO CASE. THE ARCHBISHOP WAS KILLED BY A SNIPER WHILE SAYING MASS AT A HOSPITAL FOR CANCER PATIENTS.",

AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THIS MEETING AND OTHERS THAT MAY COME CAN BE DESCRIBED AS SERIOUS DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION. WE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT SO THAT THE DELEGATIONS CAN HOLD ENOUGH DECISION-MAKING POWER FOR AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I SAID EARLIER THAT OUR PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT ACHIEVING THE COUNTRY'S REAL DEMOCRATIZATION. WE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. WE ARE NOT ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE UP THE LEGITIMACY IT SAYS IT HAS OBTAINED IN THE ELECTIONS. WE ARE ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SUBMIT IT TO A TEST FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE. IF IT PASSES THE TEST, THEN IT WOULD REAFFIRM ITS POWER. OTHERWISE, WE WERE ALWAYS RIGHT TO DEMAND A NEW CONSENSUS FOR ACHIEVING PEACE IN THE COUNTRY. ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS THEY SAID THAT OUR PROPOSALS VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION. WE HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE IT WAS MADE TO PROMOTE THE WAR. THE CONSTITUTION WAS DRAFTED BASED ON THE KILLING OF OVER 70,000 SALVADORANS. THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY DOES NOT REPRESENT A LARGE PART OF SALVADORAN SOCIETY, BUT WE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT SO THAT THERE ARE NO OBSTACLES TO REACHING AN AGREEMENT. WE HOPE A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR PEACE CAN BE DRAFTED. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT AT THE BEGINNING THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION INSISTED ON PERFORMING CERTAIN TASKS WHICH WE THOUGHT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE WRONG IDEA OF WHAT A DIALOGUE IS. WE BELIEVE THAT TO EXTEND THE DIALOGUE IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT, IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXISTING PRESSURE IN THE COUNTRY, IS TO EXTEND THE WAR. TO HOLD A DIALOGUE FULL OF DETAILS AND AGREEMENTS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE IS TO EXTEND THE WAR.",

        "text": "COMMANDER FERMAN CIENFUEGOS, WHEN WILL THE DIALOGUE RESUME? (SANCHO) WE BELIEVE THAT FOR THE DIALOGUE TO BE RESUMED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, MAINLY COLONELS PONCE AND ELENA, AND CRISTIANI MUST SPECIFICALLY ACCEPT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ONCE THIS SITUATION AND ALL THE POLITICAL ACTIONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE HAVE BEEN CLARIFIED.... (CHANGES THOUGHT) THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN THINGS VERY CLEARLY BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY TIRED OF HEARING THE FAMOUS PHRASE THAT THEY ALWAYS USE; THAT IS, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO INVESTIGATE. THAT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE; THEREFORE, WE ARE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CLARIFIED. MEANWHILE, WE ARE GOING TO TALK TO THE OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO CHECK ON HOW THE SITUATION IS DEVELOPING AND AT THE SAME TIME TO STUDY THE CONDITIONS FOR THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION. I BELIEVE THAT THE NATURE OF THE SUSPENSION HAS BEEN WELL EXPLAINED. THESE CONDITIONS MUST BE MET BEFORE WE CAN, LET US SAY, RESUME THE MEETING. IT MUST BE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THE AGREEMENT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THE CONTINUITY OF THE DIALOGUE, HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN. THIS WAS AGREED ON BY THE TWO PARTIES, AND THIS IS NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WE DID WAS SUSPEND THE MEETING THAT HAS CREATED SO MANY EXPECTATIONS. THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE A CEASE-FIRE AND A GRADUAL PROCESS TO PUT AN END TO HOSTILITIES THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE END OF THE WAR; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE DONE, WE MUST FIRST HAVE SPECIFIC DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS. THAT IS WHAT CRISTIANI SIGNED IN TELA, HONDURAS. WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE IS THE UNMASKING OF A FASCIST DICTATORSHIP. WE ARE SEEING A FASCIST AND TERRORIST CLIQUE. THE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS ARE PRACTICALLY LEGAL IN EL SALVADOR. (PASSAGE OMITTED)",

        "text": "THE FMLN FAILED EVEN BEFORE IT TRIED TO ENTER OUR COUN.... (CORRECTS HIMSELF) OUR CAPITAL, AND THIS WAS STATED BY TERRORISTS WHO HAVE SURRENDERED AND TERRORISTS WHO HAVE BEEN APPREHENDED. THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT TO THE CAPITAL UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. THEY WERE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE GOING ALONG FOR A RIDE AND THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD SUPPORT THEM, AND THAT THE ARMED FORCES WOULD NOT PUT UP A FIGHT. THIS, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, HAS BEEN THE HARSHEST BLOW FOR THE FMLN BECAUSE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE REJECTED AND SPURNED THEM WHEN THEY TRIED TO EXPOSE THE PEOPLE TO SO MUCH DANGER AND HARM. IT WAS ALSO SATISFACTORY TO HEAR THE MANY STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY GIVEN BY SO MANY SALVADORANS. THEY HAVE TALKED THROUGH THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND EVERY OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, AND HAVE REJECTED AND SPURNED THE FMLN AND ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND THE MINISTRIES OF AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMY ARE DRAFTING A PROGRAM TO HELP THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE FMLN'S ACTIONS--ONCE EVERYTHING IS CALM--AND TO RESUPPLY THE SUPERMARKETS AND STORES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE KNOW THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS GETTING FOOD FOR THE LAST 2 AND 1/2 DAYS AND THE SUPPLIES SHOULD BE BROUGHT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE DO NOT WANT TO END THIS ADDRESS WITHOUT STATING OUR DEEP GRATITUDE FOR YOUR--AND THE OTHER SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S--COURAGEOUS ATTITUDE IN THE FACE OF THE FMLN AGGRESSION. WE CAN ONLY FEEL PROUD ABOUT THE MESSAGES OF SUPPORT--NOT FOR US ON A PERSONAL BASIS BUT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, THE RIGHTS THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE DEMAND--AND FOR THE SUPPORT GIVEN TO THE ARMED FORCES, WHOSE MORALE IS HIGH AND WHO TAKE PRIDE IN THE PROFESSIONALISM WHICH THEY HAVE ACQUIRED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS TO COUNTER THE SITUATION IN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE. WE KNOW THAT THE FMLN HAS FAILED, AND NOW IT IS A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE ARMED FORCES MANAGE TO TURN THE SITUATION AROUND COMPLETELY. ALSO, WE WANT TO STATE OUR DEEP GRATITUDE TO THE FRIENDLY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY-- MOST OF ALL THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH YOU, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE-- BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN STATEMENTS WHICH, FRANKLY, HAVE FILLED US WITH EMOTION. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE OF COSTA RICA, THE UNITED STAES, GUATEMALA, AND, IN SHORT, ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW IRRATIONAL THE FMLN'S AGGRESSION IS. THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REPUBLIC, WHICH ARE THE RESULT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S WILL, HAVE BEGUN A RATIONAL, PEACEFUL, AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. TO CONCLUDE, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND UNDERSTANDING; BUT ALSO YOUR TRUST AND SERENITY. YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS FROM THE AGGRESSION WHICH THE FMLN TERRORISTS HAVE LAUNCHED. IT IS A DESPERATE ACTION AND, IN COUNTERING THE SITUATION, WE WILL BE MUCH CLOSER TO THE PEACE WE WANT SO MUCH. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND THANK YOU.",

        "text": "WHEN NAPOLEON DUARTE WAS PROCLAIMED PRESIDENT OF EL SALVADOR IN 1984, THE WHITE HOUSE, STATE DEPARTMENT, PENTAGON, AND ALL THE POWERFUL CIRCLES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE STRICKEN WITH EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM. DUARTE PROMISED A SOCIAL PACT, A TOLERANT REGIME, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS, AND, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, HE PROMISED PEACE. ALL OF THESE PROMISES WERE ONLY A MEANS OF ACHIEVING WASHINGTON'S GREAT OBJECTIVE: TO CONTROL THE REVOLUTION IN EL SALVADOR OR, IN OTHER WORDS, COUNTERINSURGENCY. FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN. IN REALITY 8 YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE EL SALVADOR BECAME THE PLACE WHERE THE REAGAN ERA'S MODELS OF COUNTERINSURGENCY, NEODICTATORSHIP, AND LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE WERE IMPLEMENTED. WASHINGTON'S EUPHORIA AND OPTIMISM HAVE COMPLETELY VANISHED. THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS SEALED THE COLLAPSE OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S SALVADORAN STRATEGY. TWO BASIC FACTORS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE U.S. FAILURE: FIRST, THE UNITED STATES SOUGHT DEMAGOGIC AND POLITICALLY UNSOUND REFORMS. DUARTE DID NOT IN ANY WAY IMPROVE THE MASSES' EXTREME POVERTY AND ISOLATION. SECOND, THE REVOLUTIONARY, POPULAR, AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES' QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PROGRESS WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS THAT LED TO THE CONFLICT ARE--TODAY MORE THAN EVER--STILL UNRESOLVED. THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS RESULTED IN AN ARENA VICTORY, AND ARENA IS THE PARTY THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST ULTRACONSERVATIVE OLIGARCHIC SECTORS. WASHINGTON HAS RETURNED TO ITS STARTING POINT. THE $3 BILLION SPENT ON MILITARY ADVICE AND THE GENOCIDE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS SERVED NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. IT IS ALL OVER. ARENA REPRESENTS A RETURN TO THE SYSTEM USED PRIOR TO 15 OCTOBER 1979. IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS A RETURN TO DICTATORIAL CONTROL OF ALL POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY POWER. THIS IS THE END, THE SAD END OF THE LOW-INTENSITY WAR EXERCISE. U.S. GENERAL HARRY GORDON SUMMER, A MEMBER OF THE SANTA FE GROUP, IN HIS BOOK ON THE MISTAKES THE UNITED STATES MADE IN VIETNAM, SAID THE UNITED STATES' CONCEPT OF VICTORY AFTER ITS DEFEAT IN VIETNAM CAN NO LONGER BE TO ACHIEVE ITS ENEMY'S UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER, AS IN WORLD WAR II, BUT TO ACHIEVE THE POLITICAL OBJECTIVES FOR WHICH IT STARTED THE WAR. THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONCEPT OF VICTORY USED IN LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE. ARENA'S VICTORY, AND THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO THE OLD SYSTEM, IS OBVIOUSLY CONTRARY TO THE OBJECTIVE OF LOW-INTENSITY WARFARE. FOR WASHINGTON, OF COURSE, THIS DEFEAT MEANS THAT $3 BILLION WAS SQUANDERED. FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND CENTRAL AMERICANS, IT MEANS RAZED TOWNS, DEVASTATED ECONOMIES, AND THE DEATH OF 70,000 PEOPLE. THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAVE A DEFINITE PLAN FOR EL SALVADOR. WHAT IT HAS IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE ALLY, ARENA, AND A SOCIAL TIME BOMB ABOUT TO EXPLODE. THE FMLN BELIEVES THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SHOULD STUDY THE NEW SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR AND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN A REALISTIC AND PRAGMATIC MANNER. THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR CONTINUES AND WILL CONTINUE AS LONG AS THERE IS NO CHANGE, NO REAL CHANGE, TO BENEFIT THE MASSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING FOR THAT CHANGE. THIS IS OUR NEW REALITY, AND IF THE NEW U.S. ADMINISTRATION WANTS PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE REGION, IT MUST ESTABLISH A FOREIGN POLICY THAT REFLECTS THAT REALITY.",

THE POLICE DETAINED HONDURANS JUAN BAUTISTA AND RIGOBERTO MATUTE AND NICARAGUAN LUIS ORDONEZ, WHO ARE BEING HELD AS SUSPECTS IN AURELIANO'S MURDER. OTHER SUSPECTS ARE STILL BEING PURSUED. ONLY BAUTISTA AND ORDONEZ WERE PRESENTED TO REPORTERS. MATUTE IS BEING HELD OUTSIDE TEGUCIGALPA AS A WITNESS IN THE CASE. ORDONEZ SAID HE \"PARTICIPATED ONLY AS A GO-BETWEEN\" SO JOSE DE JESUS PENA, THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL, COULD MEET MATUTE, WHO WORKED AS A MESSENGER FOR ORDONEZ AT THE EXCHANGE OFFICE HE RUNS IN TEGUCIGALPA. ORDONEZ ADDED: \"I WAS AWARE THAT PENA WANTED TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY, BUT I NEVER LEARNED WHO THEY WERE GOING TO KILL UNTIL 'AURELIANO' WAS ELIMINATED.\" ORDONEZ ALSO SAID HE WORKED FOR THE SOMOZA REGIME, THAT HE LATER AIDED THE CONTRAS FINANCIALLY IN HONDURAS, PARTICULARLY THE REBEL INDIAN ORGANIZATION MISURASATA (MISKITO, SUMU, AND RAMA SANDINIST UNITY), AND THAT WIDCLIFE DIEGO, A MISURASATA LEADER, OWES HIM $25,000. ORDONEZ SAID FURTHER THAT HE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE CONTRAS SEVERAL TIMES TO THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY THROUGH PENA, WHO GAVE HIM $1,000 ALMOST EVERY MONTH. ORDONEZ DENIED THAT HE PARTICIPATED DIRECTLY IN THE CRIME: \"ON SATURDAY, 7 JANUARY, WHEN 'AURELIANO' WAS KILLED, I WAS AT A COCK FIGHT IN EL PROGRESO\" ON HONDURAS' NORTHERN COAST. ORDONEZ SAID: \"I ALSO WAS IN TOUCH WITH THE HONDURAN SECRET POLICE, ONE OF WHOSE LIEUTENANTS, WORKING FOR INTERPOL, CALLED ME UP A FEW DAYS AGO. HE TOLD ME LATER, HOWEVER, THAT OTHER OFFICERS WANTED TO SEE ME. THAT IS HOW I WAS DETAINED.\" IN ADDITION, BAUTISTA CLAIMED THAT HE WAS HIRED BY MATUTE DURING TWO MEETINGS THEY HELD AND THAT MATUTE OFFERED TO PAY HIM $10,000 TO KILL SOMEBODY, PRESUMABLY A CONTRA COMMANDER WHO ALSO INTENDED TO KILL MATUTE. BAUTISTA SAID THAT A FEW DAYS PRIOR TO THE CRIME, MATUTE INTRODUCED TO HIM ANOTHER PERSON, CANO ARTEAGA, WHO IS STILL AT LARGE AND WHO TOLD BAUTISTA THAT IT WAS ORDONEZ WHO WANTED THE MAN DEAD. BAUTISTA SAID THAT, ON THE DAY OF THE CRIME, HE MET WITH MATUTE AND CANO. THEY DROVE AROUND THE PLACE SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL THEY INTERCEPTED THE CONTRA COMMANDER'S CAR. \"I OPENED FIRE WITH A .38 CALIBER REVOLVER. AURELIANO GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND WAS HIT BY MATUTE'S SHOTS. CANO FINISHED HIM OFF.\" BAUTISTA SAID HIS TWO COMPANIONS WERE ARMED WITH .45 CALIBER PISTOLS. AFTER THE CRIME, THEY WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS TO WAIT TO RECEIVE THE PROMISED MONEY IN A TEGUCIGALPA PARK ON 15 FEBRUARY. POLICE SOURCES AND COLONEL MANUEL ENRIQUE SUAREZ, HEAD OF THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' PUBLIC RELATIONS DEPARTMENT, WHO PRESENTED THE CRIMINALS TO THE REPORTERS, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE INVOLVEMENT OF A NICARAGUAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN THE CRIME. SUAREZ SAID: \"IT IS UP TO THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO COMMENT ON THIS CASE OR TO TRY TO ESTABLISH WHETHER A DIPLOMAT PARTICIPATED. THE POLICE HAVE ALREADY DONE THEIR DUTY.\" THERE WAS NOBODY AVAILABLE AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEDGED INVOLVEMENT OF ONE OF THE EMBASSY OFFICIALS IN THE ASSASSINATION. THE EMBASSY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THAT SOMEONE NAMED JOSE DE JESUS PENA WORKED THERE.",

A CAR-BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE PRC EMBASSY, WHICH IS IN THE LIMA RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT OF SAN ISIDRO. MEANWHILE, TWO BOMBS WERE THROWN AT A USSR EMBASSY VEHICLE THAT WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE EMBASSY LOCATED IN ORRANTIA DISTRICT, NEAR SAN ISIDRO. POLICE SAID THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THAT THE BOMBS BROKE WINDOWS AND DESTROYED THE TWO VEHICLES. NO ONE HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS SO FAR. POLICE SOURCES, HOWEVER, HAVE SAID THE ATTACKS COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE MAOIST \"SHINING PATH\" GROUP OR THE GUEVARIST \"TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT\" (MRTA) GROUP. THE SOURCES ALSO SAID THAT THE SHINING PATH HAS ATTACKED SOVIET INTERESTS IN PERU IN THE PAST. IN JULY 1989 THE SHINING PATH BOMBED A BUS CARRYING NEARLY 50 SOVIET MARINES INTO THE PORT OF EL CALLAO. FIFTEEN SOVIET MARINES WERE WOUNDED. SOME 3 YEARS AGO TWO MARINES DIED FOLLOWING A SHINING PATH BOMBING OF A MARKET USED BY SOVIET MARINES. IN ANOTHER INCIDENT 3 YEARS AGO, A SHINING PATH MILITANT WAS KILLED BY SOVIET EMBASSY GUARDS INSIDE THE EMBASSY COMPOUND. THE TERRORIST WAS CARRYING DYNAMITE. THE ATTACKS TODAY COME AFTER SHINING PATH ATTACKS DURING WHICH LEAST 10 BUSES WERE BURNED THROUGHOUT LIMA ON 24 OCT.",

        "text": "THE PERUVIAN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN TODAY ENTERED ITS FINAL STRETCH, WITH ONLY ONE WEEK TO GO IN AN ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST DISPUTED AND DANGEROUS ONE IN THE HISTORY OF THAT ANDEAN COUNTRY, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF TERRORIST THREATS. THE SPREADING WAVE OF TERRORISM, AIMED AT STOPPING THE ELECTIONS FROM TAKING PLACE, FORCED PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA'S ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE DRASTIC SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 3,500 CANDIDATES (PASSAGE INDISTINCT) ARE DEPLOYED, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS UNDER STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WHERE THE ACTIVITIES OF SHINING PATH'S TERRORIST GANGS ARE MORE WIDESPREAD, SUCH AS LIMA AND THE DEPARTMENTS OF AYACUCHO, HUANCAVELICA, APURIMAC, AND JUNIN. THE GOVERNMENT HAS APPOINTED FOUR MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES TO PROTECT EACH CANDIDATE AND HAS TAKEN OUT LIFE INSURANCE ON ALMOST 250,000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY LOTTERY TO WORK AT OVER 52,000 POLLING STATIONS. IN LIMA ALONE, HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OF POLLING STATION TEAMS HAVE ASKED TO BE RELIEVED OF THIS DUTY, PETITIONS WHICH FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN REFUSED BY THE THE ELECTORAL COURT. IN LIMA, THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO NORMAL ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY COULD BE THE STRIKE OF PRIVATE BUS OWNERS WHO ARE AFRAID OF TERRORIST REPRISALS. THE \"MINI-BUS-OWNERS\" (INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OF URBAN BUSES) HAVE ASKED THAT FOUR POLICEMEN BE ASSIGNED TO EACH BUS, A REQUEST THAT DEPARTMENTAL PREFECT (GOVERNOR) JACOBO MISHKIN HAS DEEMED \"IMPOSSIBLE.\" \"IF THERE IS NO TRANSPORTATION, THE PEOPLE WILL WALK,\" PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA HAS SAID, REAFFIRMING HIS \"ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE\" THAT THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE WILL VOTE EN MASSE -- DESPITE THE TERRORIST THREATS -- TO \"STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY,\" RECOVERED IN 1980 AFTER 12 YEARS OF MILITARY GOVERNMENTS. PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA, NATIONAL ELECTION BOARD PRESIDENT CARLOS CASTANEDA, AND THE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN URGING THE NEARLY 10 MILLION VOTERS TO COMPLY WITH THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY BY CASTING THEIR VOTES. THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT A LARGE TURNOUT WILL AMOUNT TO \"THE MOST EFFECTIVE REJECTION OF SUBVERSION\" AND THAT IT WILL \"STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY\" IN PERU, WHICH HAS ALMOST 22 MILLION INHABITANTS. OUT OF THE NINE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, FOUR HAVE THE BEST CHANCES, ALTHOUGH ONLY THE CANDIDATE OF THE CENTER RIGHT, MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, IS THE CLEAR-CUT FAVORITE. HE WILL GET AN ESTIMATED 45 PERCENT OF THE VOTES, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST SURVEYS. ACCORDING TO PERUVIAN LAW, IF VARGAS LLOSA DOES NOT GET ABSOLUTE MAJORITY HE WILL HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN A RUNOFF ELECTION WITH THE SECOND-PLACE CANDIDATE. SINCE IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT VARGAS LLOSA, THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO), WILL WIN THE FIRST ROUND, THE QUESTION NOW IS WHO WILL BE HIS RIVAL FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN THE SECOND ROUND. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYS, THE CANDIDATES WITH THE BEST CHANCE ARE LUIS ALVA CASTRO OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA), WITH 19 PERCENT OF THE VOTES; ALFONSO BARRANTES LINGAN OF THE SOCIALIST LEFT (IS), WITH 12 PERCENT; AND HENRY PEASE OF THE COMMUNIST LEFT WING COALITION UNITED LEFT (IU), WITH 8 PERCENT. DURING THE LAST FIVE DAYS OF THEIR CAMPAIGNS THE CANDIDATES WILL STEP UP THEIR TRIPS TO VARIOUS POINTS OF THE COUNTRY TRYING TO GAIN THE VOTES OF A LARGE UNDECIDED SECTOR OF THE POPULATION. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEYS, THIS SECTOR REPRESENTS BETWEEN 18 AND 20 PERCENT OF THE VOTES. MEANWHILE THE TERRORISTS CONTINUE ON THEIR PATH OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. IN THE LAST 24 HOURS THE SHINING PATH MURDERED TWO STATE OFFICIALS OF THE (WORDS INDISTINCT) ON A ROAD LINKING CHAVIN AND HUARI, TWO TOWNS IN ANCASH DEPARTMENT. IN HUARAZ, THE CAPITAL OF ANCASH DEPARTMENT, THE TERRORISTS SET FIRE TO THE OFFICES OF THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION BUT INJURED NO ONE. ONE PERSON DIED WHEN AN ORE TRAIN WAS DERAILED NEAR OROYA, A KEY MINING TOWN IN THE PERUVIAN CENTRAL JUNGLE AREA, WHERE AN ELECTORAL REGISTRATION OFFICE WAS LOCATED. SEVEN PRIVATE BANK BRANCHES WERE ALSO ATTACKED AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGED IN LIMA. IN BARRANCA, A SMALL VILLAGE 180 KM FROM LIMA, TERRORISTS BOMBED A RADIO STATION AND A DRUGSTORE, BOTH OF THEM BELONGING TO SANTIAGO JAO, A FREDEMO CANDIDATE FOR DEPUTY.",

SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ (AS HEARD) REPORTED TODAY THAT SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED. THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID. THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT. THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.

THE FPMR IS A CLANDESTINE LEFTIST GROUP THAT PROMOTES \"ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE\" AGAINST THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT HEADED BY GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET. POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY BUILDING AND TO NEARBY STRUCTURES IN THE ELEGANT PROVIDENCIA NEIGHORHOOD IN EASTERN SANTIAGO. THE GOVERNMENT CHARGES THAT THE FPMR, WHICH ON 14 DECEMBER WILL MARK 6 YEARS OF SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY, IS THE \"ARMED BRANCH\" OF THE OUTLAWED COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE. AS OF MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THE CARABINEROS AND POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS WERE CARRYING OUT AN INTENSIVE OPERATION TO ARREST THOSE RESPONISBLE FOR THE ATTACK.",

SHE HAS DESCRIBED U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO AS AN ERP (PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY) MEMBER IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS. AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, CASOLO WAS RELEASED BY A MILITARY JUDGE AFTER HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AGAINST HER. SOME GROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT RELEASED. AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II BOULEVARD. THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE SALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF STUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE PREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE .45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES. AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT SHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND. AGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS TO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER FERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UES). AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS, ESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT. THE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS. IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING POSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH FERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE POLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE SO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS. THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S HOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM, TOLD HER ABOUT IT. OTHER TERRORISTS WENT TO CASOLO'S HOUSE TO GET WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES TO CONDUCT THEIR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST BUSES, TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION BOXES, POWER PYLONS, OR TO CONDUCT LARGE OPERATIONS--AS AGUILAR DESCRIBED THEM-- SUCH AS ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION OBTAINED, THE PRISONER WILL BE SENT TO COURT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.",

THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT 2130 (0130 GMT) ON THURSDAY (AS RECEIVED). IT DAMAGED WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK. JOSE PARADA GRANDY, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE CHIEF, TOLD EFE THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON STEPPED OUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED A PACKAGE IN ONE OF THE PLANT POTS ON JUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FEW METERS FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ. PARADA SAID: \"THE VEHICLE LEFT AND IMMEDIATELY THE CHARGE WENT OFF CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.\" THE \"ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION,\" A GROUP WITH AN INDIAN BAKCGROUND, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN A COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS SENT TO SOME MEDIA. THE NOTE, SIGNED WITH THE INITIALS OF THE \"ZARATE WILLKA\" GROUP, STATES: \"IN DEFENSE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE. DEATH TO THE INVADER. OUR HATRED IS RELENTLESS; OUR WAR IS TO DEATH.\" THE \"ZARATE WILLKA\" GROUP CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY IN AUGUST 1988 FOR THE ATTACK AGAINST THEN U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ AND THE KILLING OF TWO MORMON MISSIONARIES. TODAY'S BOMB EXPLOSION DAMAGED THE SHELVES OF A BOOK STORE, THE \"PEOPLE'S PERUVIAN BANK,\" THE STATE BANK (NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED); THE MARISCAL BALLIVIAN BUILDING, AND OTHER SHOPS, ALL OF WHICH ARE LOCATED NEAR THE U.S. EMBASSY. AFTER THE EXPLOSION, A GROUP OF U.S. AGENTS CALLED OFF AN INVESTIGATION AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SHOUTED AT THEM, \"YANKEES, OUT OF PANAMA.\" THE U.S. EMBASSY PRESS ATTACHE, BRUCE WARTON, SAID TODAY THAT \"IT IS OBVIOUSLY A DESPICABLE ACTION THAT DOES MORE HARM TO BOLIVIANS THAN TO THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE WE HAVE SUFFERED NO DAMAGES.\"",

        "text": "FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I AM ADDRESSING YOU AFTER OUR COUNTRY HAS BEGUN TO OVERCOME, WITH EFFORT AND TENACITY, THE FIRST OBSTACLES OF A SERIOUS CRISIS, THE FUTURE IMPLICATIONS AND REPERCUSSIONS OF WHICH WE STILL DO NOT KNOW. I THEREFORE WANTED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW THEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION. FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC AGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS, THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED. THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINY HAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING, COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TO FIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US. ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TO BOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCH THREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, OR COMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO -- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY JEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM THEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IF THEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY. HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YET WHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING THAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN NATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL. GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF TREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES, FATHERLAND, OR LAW. CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE IN ALL FIELDS. THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES HAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A LIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUE EFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEAN FRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER MARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION. WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS. I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. MANY TIMES YOU HAVE HEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY. WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A WORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO HAVE LESS. INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR OWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US. IF LOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE GREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT, UNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS, AND WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE CONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD MEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER. A FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL PRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL, AND ALL FUELS. IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE. PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS. HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE ISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL. WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN WHAT IT HAS. HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES, ESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE. TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE. IN GENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE. IF WE SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A GOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS AVAILABLE. IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO IMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS. THEREFORE, LET US THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN FAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BUY A VEHICLE. WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS EXAMPLE. WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE, WHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS CAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE LITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING. THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE HAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER. MOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES TO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT BUS FARES. THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING -- THROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN NOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO PRICE INCREASE. THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE GAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES ARE NOT INCREASED. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF SOLIDARITY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE. SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR SONS. WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT CHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG. WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT FIND A JOB. THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE. LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE. THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS TO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS. WE ARE BEGINNING TO SENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE. WE ARE FEELING HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC. HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE SHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE. ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET DISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO SUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY. THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO SEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND ACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE. THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR COUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION. IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS. WE WANT ALL SALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT THOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN COME OUT AHEAD. THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.",

        "text": "MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ ONCE MORE INSISTED TODAY ON \"AN IMMEDIATE DIALOGUE\" BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COCAINE TRAFFICKERS \"TO END THE WAR IN WHICH INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED.\" THE MAYOR REITERATED HIS POSITION WHEN HE COMMENTED ON THE ATTACK IN WHICH 20 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND APPROXIMATELY 100 WERE INJURED, WHICH WAS PERPETRATED YESTERDAY BY TERRORISTS ON THE DRUG CARTEL'S PAYROLL NEAR ITAGUI MUNICIPALITY. THE BLAST FROM THE EXPLOSION HIT A TRUCK FULL OF POLICEMEN, WHO HAD EARLIER CARRIED OUT AN ANTI-MAFIA OPERATION IN A PEASANT VILLAGE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL PUBLIC BUSES, HOUSES, AND BUSINESSES. A POLICE EXPERT SAID THAT THE CAR BOMB (CONTAINING 300 KG OF DYNAMITE) WAS ACTIVATED BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE ELITE FORCE PATROL PASSED BY. ACCORDING TO GOMEZ MARTINEZ, \"THESE ACTIONS WILL ONLY CEASE WHEN (PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS') GOVERNMENT PUTS ASIDE SO MUCH PREJUDICE AND AGREES TO THE PEACE TALKS,\" PROPOSED BY THE SUBVERSIVES. \"THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE SONNER OR LATER, AND IT IS BETTER TO START NOW,\" INSISTED THE MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, A CITY WHERE THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL CARTEL HAS ITS BASE OF OPERATIONS. THE CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL GANG, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION OF MEDELLIN POLICEMEN IN RETALIATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. TWENTY-EIGHT POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS CITY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. ACCORDING TO SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, YESTERDAY'S ATTACK \"COULD BE ESCOBAR GAVIRIA'S RESPONSE TO THE ARREST OF ADOLFO MESA MENESES,\" HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN. MESA MENESES WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, SECRET POLICE), AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF ASSASSINATING -- ON ORDERS FROM THE MAFIA LEADER -- LEFTIST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, AS WELL AS A CHIEF OF POLICE, A MAYOR, AND SEVERAL JOURNALISTS. MEANWHILE, HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND DETECTIVES ARE CARRYING OUT LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN THE COLOMBIAN COUNTRYSIDE AND BORDER AREAS ON THE SUSPICION THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANS TO FLEE THE COUNTRY. LAST NIGHT, A TELEVISION NEWSCAST SHOWED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE \"DRUG LORD\" THAT HAD BEEN \"RECENTLY\" TAKEN BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS AT A COLOMBIAN BEACH ON THE PACIFIC COAST. A POLICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED TODAY THAT \"WE HAVE RELIABLE INFORMATION ON HIS WHEREABOUTS,\" ALTHOUGH HE REFRAINED FROM GIVING FURTHER DETAILS. UNOFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA \"IS SOMEWHERE IN WESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT\" -- OF WHICH MEDELLIN IS THE CAPITAL -- WHERE THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE CONCENTRATED. COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR THE COOPERATION OF BRAZIL, ECUADOR, PANAMA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA TO STOP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ESCAPING TO THOSE COUNTRIES.",

IF WE MAKE ANY MOVE, IT WILL BE TO ADVANCE TOWARD THE ENEMY BARRACKS, BECAUSE WE WILL SEIZE POWER AND EXPEL THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP THAT HAS INSTALLED ITSELF IN OUR HOMELAND. THE FMLN MAINTAINS FOR THE 7TH DAY ITS POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS. WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN SAN MIGUEL; WE HAVE MADE AN IMPORTANT SEIZURE OF WEAPONS IN SAN MIGUEL. THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE BETTER IN SAN SALVADOR. LAST NIGHT WE REPORTED THAT THE ARCH OF LIBERTY EXISTS IN THE CAPITAL; IT IS COMPRISED OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING PROJECTS -- WHERE THE PROTAGONISTS OF THIS HISTORY ARE THE MASSES, WHICH ARE ORGANIZED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF TRENCHES AND BARRICADES. THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION. RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN. POPULAR COMMITTEES MUST BE ORGANIZED; THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES; BUT IF THE ENEMY IS NEAR, THIS MUST BE DONE CLANDESTINELY. ALL THE GROUPS IN EACH TOWN, MEANING THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS, TEACHERS ORGANIZATIONS, AND COOPERATIVES, MUST ALL ORGANIZE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS. OUR UNITY MUST BECOME THE BEST TOOL TO EVICT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE MURDEROUS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WHICH ASSASSINATES PRIESTS AND WHICH BOMBED THE CAPITAL AGAIN EARLY THIS MORNING. IT HAS AGAIN CAUSED MORE DEATHS AND WOUNDED IN SAN SALVADOR. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN, AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY MUST PARTICIPATE. IF THE ARMED FORCES ARE NEAR, THEN CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION MUST BE CONDUCTED IN SMALL TOWNS, VILLAGES, AND NEIGHBORHOODS. THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVE TO CONSPIRE AGAINST DEATH, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE ASSASSINS, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST POVERTY, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HUNGER, AND TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE BOMBINGS. IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE; IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. EL SALVADOR MUST BECOME A BODY COMPRISED OF ORGANIZED CELLS -- EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM -- REGARDLESS OF THE PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL PARTY. WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA (NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE) RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMENT WOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO ALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY. WE URGE THEM TO UNITE AND STOP THE WAR; AND THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR -- WITH THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "LAWYER CARLOS OLDINEY REPORTED THE GANG AND FEDERAL AGENTS VALDEMIR LOPEZ PRAZERES AND LUIS JOSE DA CONCEICAO AND DETECTIVES PAULO MASSANHYO AND CARLOS ANGEL SERRANO CASTILESSO WERE ARRESTED. CAMBARALAMAIA'S ORGANIZATION IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GANGS IN THE REGION THAT DEALS WITH BOLIVIAN COCAINE. ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY GERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE OF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS. PALERMO OWNS FOUR TWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN. HE ALSO EXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA. ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE BRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY, WHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS. PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING THE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA. THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE SECTORS. PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO VIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY. VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS THAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO BENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION. THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE PALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE SUPPLIER. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO DO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE CORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO SUAREZ. MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM SMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE STOLEN IN BRAZIL. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\" THIS INVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY OF DRUGS EVERY DAY. THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS. MOST OF THEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO. THEY FOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO SUAREZ. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS CARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA. GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS. PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA, ARGENTINA. HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS OF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES THE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN BOLIVIA. BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA. IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE WHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL), NEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES OF COCAINE. NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE. THE DRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND ACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE LARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES. DOZENS OF DRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN BY LAW. THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR, AND LAND. IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE TRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS, AND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.

PRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS EXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN GENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU? (GARCIA) AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY. (REPORTER) WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY? (GARCIA) WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE. (AMAT) WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE... (GARCIA, INTERRUPTING) SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT. HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF TRUTHS. ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS. THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO EDUCATING. THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO. (AMAT) NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA? WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS HIM. (GARCIA) BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE ME AS PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER) (AMAT) EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE? (GARCIA) I DID NOT SAY SO. I DO NOT KNOW. I NEVER FALL TO THE LEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES. I MAKE AN OUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE. (AMAT) MR. PRESIDENT, (WORDS INDISTINCT) THIS DIALOGUE (WORDS INDISTINCT) FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS. ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY, (WORDS INDISTINCT), HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE SUMMIT? (GARCIA) VERY WELL. COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED, MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING. THIS IS NOT ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA. IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL TACKLE IT. THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO BOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE CONTINENT. AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS. LET COLOMBIANS HAVE CONFIDENCE.",

        "text": "THE CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF (COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE) HAS CATEGORICALLY DENIED THAT THERE ARE ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS ASSERTED BY THE WASHINGTON POST. THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE ALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN WHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING CHARGED. COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT 52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL. (BEGIN RECORDING) (PONCE) OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE NORMAL AS USUAL. THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING WITH US. (REPORTER) WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S. ADVISERS HAVE ORGINIATED? (PONCE) I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND. THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS A POOR COUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID. (REPORTER) FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS LIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS? (PONCE) AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US. AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH ME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT. THE SAME HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR. I FAIL TO SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. (END RECORDING) THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP CONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF PROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES. (BEGIN RECORDING) (PONCE) WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR ARE PLANNED. WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE OR THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) ORGANIZATION FRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC ORDER. IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. (END RECORDING) THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY. THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES MORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS. MEANWHILE, COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BASED IN USULUTAN, AND IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT THE CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONIES OF THE ARMED FORCES MILITARY TRAINING CENTER HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WHERE COLONEL FRANCISCO ARTURO LOPEZ WILL BE IN COMMAND REPLACING COLONEL CARLOS ALFREDO RIVAS, WHO HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.",

THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE WERE ABOARD THE ECUADORAN FLAGSHIP: U.S. CITIZEN SCOTT HEYNDAL, ECUADOREANS LUIS ANTONIO MENESES BENAVIDES AND EDWIN RODRIGO TENEDA PARRENO, AND COLOMBIAN PILOT JULIO TORRES. MR. TORRES WAS KILLED AND MR. MENESES WAS WOUNDED. THE ATTACKERS, WHO WORE FIELD UNIFORMS OF THE COLOMBIAN MILITARY, BOARDED THE ECUADORAN VESSEL, AND, AFTER NOTICING THAT MR. MENESES WAS WOUNDED, GAVE HIM 100,000 COLOMBIAN PESOS AND THEN LEFT HIM AND MR. TORRES' BODY. THE ATTACKERS RETURNED TO COLOMBIA TAKING HEYNDAL AND TENEDA WITH THEM. THEY CROSSED THE BORDER AND SAILED UPRIVER FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS ON THE RUMIYACU RIVER. THE ATTACKERS SPENT THE EVENING AT A CAMP NEAR THE RIVER AND FORCED MR. HEYNDAL TO WRITE LETTERS TO HIS BOSS AT THE MINING PROJECT, MR. JEFF SINO, ALSO A U.S. CITIZEN, AND TO HIS WIFE. THOSE LETTERS WERE GIVEN TO MR. TENEDA, WHO RECEIVED 20,000 COLOMBIAN PESOS. HE WAS THEN ORDERED TO RETURN TO ECUADOR AND GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR DELIVERING THE LETTERS.",

A REPORT SAYS THAT A DMIFA ARMED FORCES ENGINEERS' MILITARY DETACHMENT UNIT WAS AT SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL, AND THAT THE ENTIRE UNIT WAS WIPED OUT. THE SOLDIERS HAD A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY STATION IN THE BUILDING. AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, THERE WERE 20 CASUALTIES. AMONG THE CASUALTIES IS A LIEUTENANT WHO WAS THE UNIT CHIEF, AND TWO SERGEANTS. THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED. THE SITUATION IS NOT AS THE FASCIST CRISTIANI REPORTED IT TO BE. HE SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOLDIER AT THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. THAT IS TOTALLY FALSE. THE BUILDING HOUSED A GARRISON NOT A HOSPITAL, BECAUSE A DMIFA UNIT AND A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY CENTER WERE THERE. IT WAS A GARRISON. WE ARE GOING TO CORRECT OUR REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE ATTACK ON THE DMIFA UNIT: 20 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 10 WERE WOUNDED. IN ALL, THERE WERE 30 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING TWO SERGEANTS AND THE UNIT CHIEF. WE REPEAT: IN AN IMPRESSIVE ATTACK ON A MILITARY POSITION AT SANTA TERESA HOSPITAL--THE BUILDING WAS NO LONGER A HOSPITAL BUT AN ARMY COMMUNICATIONS CENTER--OUR FIGTHTERS ANNIHILATED AND DESTROYED THAT POSITION. THE ARMY SUSTAINED 20 KILLED AND 10 WOUNDED. THE COMMUNICATIONS RELAY STATION WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED.",

(MODERATOR) PABLO GUILLERMO (WORDS INDISTINCT). (REPORTER) MR. PRESIDENT, THE NEWSPAPER LA JORNADA OF MEXICO STATED YESTERDAY THAT COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY THIS WEEKEND WITH ALL HIS FAMILY AND WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE, WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT HE DID NOT GO ON A MERE VACATION. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF THIS. (LAUGHTER) (CRISTIANI) YOU SAY HE LEFT WHEN? (REPORTER) YESTERDAY. (CRISTIANI) WELL, ONLY IF HE LEFT VERY HURRIEDLY AFTER MIDDAY. I WAS WITH HIM HERE YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OTHER THINGS, AS WELL AS MILITARY MATTERS WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY MINISTERS. HE WAS PRESENT. UNLESS HE MAY HAVE LEFT. I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE I HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE THE ORDER OF THE MONTH ON SATURDAY AND HE WAS PRESENT. PARDON ME, THAT WAS TUESDAY WHEN WE HAD THE ORDER FOR THE END OF THE MONTH. I UNDERSTAND HE WAS PRESENT AT THE COMMANDERS MEETING. IF HE LEFT LAST WEEKEND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE WEEKEND AND HE RETURNED ON MONDAY. (MODERATOR) MARIA CORTINA, NOTIMEX. (REPORTER) MR. PRESIDENT, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A CUT IN MILITARY AID AFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS? (CRISTIANI) WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING OPPOSITE SIGNS FROM THE FMLN IN TERMS OF WANTING TO TRULY PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE. A SIGN OF THIS WAS THE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT. THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE GROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A MILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS. THOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY PATH. THAT COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL OF A MILITARY SOLUTION IN THE MINDS OF SOME. THIS COULD REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. (MODERATOR) RAUL MONGE, CADENA RADIO CENTRO. (REPORTER) MR. PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GUERRILLAS' MORALE AT THIS MOMENT? (CRISTIANI) WELL, I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE MORALE OF THE GUERRILLAS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE MUST HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERBLY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE THERE WAS A LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR PART IN THE FORM OF CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT THE OFFENSIVE DID NOT REPRESENT A SUCCESS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHOW OF FORCE, WHICH IS A LOT OF MALARKEY. ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY. WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF EVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE. IN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED. ON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT VIOLENCE. THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS MEMBERS. I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A COMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED OF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE MILITARY PATH. THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE. WHAT I WANT TO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT THE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK. WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A COUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL DESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH THAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "WE ARE RECEIVING A REPORT RIGHT NOW ON THE SITUATION IN SAN SALVADOR. THE REPORT SAYS THAT SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE STILL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN). ARMED FORCES OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN. THE REPORT ADDS THAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY. SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES ARE MAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARY ENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE. PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING (CHANGES THOUGHT) HERE IS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS SHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITION. THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING. WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN. THERE ARE MANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR. THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING THEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS. WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE WITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS. MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY FOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR CITY. IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN FIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE REGIME'S INCOMPETENCE. THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A STATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR. ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON THE MEDIA. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS NEWSCASTS. WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO NEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR? WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING? THIS IS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER. THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY. COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG. YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID. COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS YOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR COOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR. LET'S GO TO THE TOP AND THAT'S IT.",

        "text": "PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI SAID TODAY THAT DESPITE THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S (FMLN) TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST SALVADORANS, HIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE REBELS. HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK THIS MORNING. PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE FMLN: (BEGIN RECORDING) (CRISTIANI) IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE. THE FMLN COMMITTED THIS CRIME. I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT. WE WILL, OF COURSE, INVESTIGATE THE CRIME. I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION. (REPORTER) (WORDS INDISTINCT) WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS (WORDS INDISTINCT)? (CRISTIANI) THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION. THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND BY APPLYING THE LAW. THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY. WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION. TODAY WE WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS. THE NAMES OF THE COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION IS FULLY FORMED. (REPORTER) (WORDS INDISTINCT) THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS COMMISSION? (CRISTIANI) (WORDS INDISTINCT) THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE. THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD THIS GOAL. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE POLITICAL COMMISSION. (REPORTER) WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT? (CRISTIANI) I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENT (WORD INDISTINCT). THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY. MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED. WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM.

ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN, THE TASK IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE BODIES WERE SCATTERED OVER A RADIUS OF 8 KM. THE PLANE DEPARTED BOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT DOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR. BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN COORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO EXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST ACTION. THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM THE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S. FEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION. ANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK NEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION WAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE. THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO AIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.",

        "text": "OUT OF THE TEN CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENCY, THE FOUR WHO HAVE THE BEST CHANCES OF WINNING HAVE INSERTED IN THEIR GOVERNMENT PLATFORMS SOLUTIONS TO THE CRISIS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAS TAKEN HOLD OF THE COUNTRY, CAUSED MAINLY BY THE NARCOTRAFFICKING MAFIAS AND THE GUERRILLA GROUPS. FOR LIBERAL CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, \"NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS\" MUST BE FOUND THROUGH A CONDITIONED DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS AND BY STRENGTHENING JUSTICE TO CONFRONT THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS \"BECAUSE EXTRADITION CANNOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO FIGHT THIS CRIME.\" GAVIRIA, 43, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS IS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED VIRGILIO BARCO AS PRESIDENT AFTER THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS, HAS MADE THE PROBLEMS OF THE GUERRILLAS AND DRUG MAFIAS THE TWO MAIN ISSUES IN HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM. REGARDING THE ARMED REBELS, HE INSISTS THAT NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS MUST BE FOUND AND PROMISES TO \"TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION\" THE MERITS OF WHAT HAS BEEN TESTED UP TO NOW. \"THE DIALOGUE WITH THE ARMED REBELS IS A CONCESSION THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO THEM, AND FOR THIS REASON SOCIETY HAS EVERY RIGHT TO ESTABLISH CONDITIONS,\" GAVIRIA STATED. \"THUS,\" HE ADDED, \"THE DIALOGUE WILL PREVENT THE GUERRILLAS FROM HAVING A POLITICAL PROTAGONIST ROLE AND WILL AVERT THE JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE.\" SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, 47, INSISTS THAT \"THE SURRENDER OF THE MAFIA LORDS MUST BE ACHIEVED\" AND THAT THIS \"SHOULD INCLUDE PENALTIES FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED, ECONOMIC COMPENSATION, AND THE CERTAINTY THAT COLOMBIA WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LEND ITSELF TO PRODUCE AND EXPORT DRUGS.\" LLOREDA CAICEDO IS OPPOSED TO THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES, AND HE OFFERS TO \"STRENGTHEN JUSTICE\" AND TO CHANGE PROCEDURES SO AS TO SURROUND JUDGES WITH GUARANTEES, ALL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THROUGH A PLEBISCITE TO CONVOKE A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. FOR THE ARMED REBELS, HE OFFERS \"A 12-MONTH TERM FOR THEM TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE\" AND THE DRAFTING OF \"MECHANISMS\" FOR THEIR DISBANDING, SUCH AS THE \"NATIONAL CIRCUMSCRIPTION\" THAT WILL FACILITATE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL LIFE. LLOREDA CAICEDO, FOREIGN MINISTER DURING BELISARIO BETANCUR'S ADMINISTRATION AND ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE CONTADORA GROUP TO ATTAIN PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID THAT AN EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO \"RECOVER THE MONOPOLY OF THE PUBLIC FORCE AND CONSOLIDATE ITS SOVEREIGN PRESENCE.\" ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO, 71, A \"DISSIDENT\" CONSERVATIVE, MAINTAINS THAT WITHOUT THE STRENGTHENING OF MORALS AND THE LAW -- \"THE ROOT OF OUR ILLS\" -- COEXISTENCE AND PROGRESS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE. HE PLEDGES TO RESCUE THOSE TWO VALUES. GOMEZ HURTADO PRESENTED TO COLOMBIAN VOTERS A FIVE-POINT \"AGREEMENT ON BASIC ISSUES,\" INCLUDING LAW AND MORALS, JUSTICE, ECONOMIC PLANNING, AND ECOLOGY, AS HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT ON 27 MAY. ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, THE M-19 (19 APRIL MOVEMENT) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, WHO REPLACED THE ASSASSINATED CARLOS PIZARRO, BELIEVES THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM ARE \"BASIC\" TO REACHING PEACE. NAVARRO WOLFF, 41, HAS REITERATED THAT HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE CHAIN OF ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY DRUG TERRORISTS IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. REGARDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THEY REQUIRE \"MORE SERIOUS TREATMENT.\" THEREFORE, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE \"A POOR DIALOGUE RATHER THAN A GOOD WAR,\" AND IF THAT DIALOGUE PRODUCES GOOD RESULTS \"WE MUST HOLD ON TO IT,\" HE SAID. THE FOUR CANDIDATES AGREE ON REFORMING THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE CONSTITUTION BY CONVOKING A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. THEY ALSO SHARE OPINIONS ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC OPENING TOWARD INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND PROMOTION OF AN \"AGRO-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\" WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A REDUCTION OR STABILIZATION OF THE RATE OF INFLATION.",

RIVERA Y DAMAS ADMITTED, NEVERTHELESS, THAT GENERALIZED PERSECUTION OF THE CHURCH HAS DIMINISHED, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT DISAPPEARED, AND ADDED THAT OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS MANY PRIESTS HAVE BEEN KILLED, INCLUDING AN ARCHBISHOP, \"BUT THE BLOOD OF MARTYRS IS THE SEED OF CHRISTIANS,\" HE SAID. RIVERA Y DAMAS POINTED OUT THAT HE HAS RECEIVED MANY COMPLAINTS CONCERNING THE CHURCH'S POSITION ON THE JESUITS' MURDER, BUT TODAY \"IT IS KNOWN THAT THE ARCHBISHOPRIC WAS RIGHT TO POINT OUT WHERE IT BELIEVED THE MURDERERS WERE. THIS POSITION WAS CONFIRMED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO, BY FULFILLING HIS PROMISE TO GET TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE CASE THROUGH INVESTIGATIONS, HAS BECOME WORTHY OF WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION.\" IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS HOMILY RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID TODAY THAT \"TO BE BISHOP OF A PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED THE SCOURGE OF A FRATRICIDAL WAR FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS IMPLIES HAVING VERY DEEPLY ROOTED MERCY FOR HUMAN PAIN, WHICH MUST TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER ANY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, OR IDEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND IS AN IRREVOCABLE PLEDGE.\" THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ECLESSIASTICAL EVENTS OF THE WEEK IN SAN SALVADOR WERE THE SALVADORAN EPISCOPAL CONFERENCE, WHICH CONCLUDED WITH A CALL FOR PEACE, AND THE CONSIGNMENT TO COURTS OF JUSTICE OF THE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF MURDERING THE JESUIT PRIESTS. THERE WAS SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE MEETING, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT A LETTER HAD BEEN SENT TO THE BISHOPS BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, REQUESTING THE CHURCH'S MEDIATION AND ITS EFFORTS TO RESUME A DIALOGUE. \"I BELIEVE,\" MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, \"THAT THE MEETINGS OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE FMLN WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL ARE IMPORTANT.\" TO CONCLUDE, RIVERA Y DAMAS REITERATED THAT \"WE MUST END THIS WAR THROUGH DIALOGUE AND RATIONAL MEANS BEFORE THE WAR FINISHES US ALL.\"",

WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT DO? (GONZALEZ) I BELIEVE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING ALL THE ROADS TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT. THROUGH REPRESSION IT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF LABOR UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS RESOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS PEACEFULLY. THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS. THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS. THE PEOPLE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE. IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMED ACTIONS. AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION, ARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THE REGIME. THE WORKERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ENTITLED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LABOR BENEFITS. DEFENSE IS LEGITIMATE. IT IS LEGITIMATE FOR THE WORKERS TO DECIDE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE ARMED WAY, THROUGH VIOLENCE. IT IS THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, PONCE, AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHO ARE LEAVING THE WORKERS NO ALTERNATIVE. (REPORTER) TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER: IN RECENT HOURS THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL, INCLUDING BOMB ATTACKS ON THE RESIDENCES OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS SUCH AS RUBEN ZAMORA AND ARONETE DIAZ, AN ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF COLONEL CARRANZA, AND AN ATTACK ON A RELATIVE OF COLONEL LOPEZ HUILA, AMONG OTHERS. THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ATTACKS. (GONZALEZ) OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE STRICTLY MILITARY. ALL OUR GUERRILLA UNITS FUNCTION ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, BE IT IN THE RURAL AREAS OR IN THE CITIES WHERE OUR URBAN COMMANDOS OPERATE. THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER OPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY. THE FMLN'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN OR POLITICIANS. THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLE HERE AND ABROAD. WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE? TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVE POLICY. IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS. IT HAS GONE FROM THE SELECTIVE CAPTURE AND MURDER OF LEADERS TO MASS ARRESTS, AND FROM MASS ARRESTS IT HAS MOVED INTO GENOCIDE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS. IT IS CLEAR THAT ITS OBJECTIVE IS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT IN SAN JOSE. IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS TRYING TO CREATE CONFUSION, BUT THE PEOPLE ABROAD AND WE KNOW THAT OUR ACTIONS ARE AIMED AT MILITARY OBJECTIVES.",

        "text": "THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED TODAY IN A TELEPHONE CALL TO A RADIO STATION BY AN ALLEGED MEMBER, ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF CARLOS PIZARRO, POLITICAL LEADER AND FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER. THE CALLER IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS JOHN JAIRO ARIAS TASCON. HE CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK IN MEDELLIN TO DENOUNCE THAT THE CHARGES AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL ARE PART OF A PLAN TO BLAME THEM FOR ALL VIOLENT ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY. THE AUTHORS OF THE ASSASSINATION ARE SECTORS WHO SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY, ARIAS TASCON ADDED. PIZARRO, FORMER LEADER OF THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), THE GUERRILLA GROUP THAT LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH, WAS KILLED BY THE IMPACT OF THREE BULLETS FIRED AT HIM ABOARD A COLOMBIAN AVIANCA FLIGHT THAT WAS EN ROUTE TO THE CITY OF BARRANQUILLA ALONG THE COUNTRY'S ATLANTIC COAST. AFTER THE CRIME, AT 1100 (1600 GMT), AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS SAPATOCA CALLED CARACOL TO REPORT THAT THE KILLING HAD BEEN ORDERED BY FIDEL CASTANO AND HENRY PEREZ, HEADS OF THE EXTREME RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY MILITIAS. SAPATOCA ADDED THAT CASTANO AND PEREZ PERPETRATED THE CRIME FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM THE EXTRADITABLES. CASTANO WAS CONNECTED TO THE DEATH OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ALSO A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FOR THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION (UP), ON 22 MARCH, ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTANO HEADED A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT DID NOT IMPLICATE THE EXTRADITABLES. ON THAT OCCASION PABLO ESCOBAR, LEADER OF THE EXTRADITABLES AND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD KILLED JARAMILLO. A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT DRAFTED RECENTLY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE), SAID THAT SOME ARMY AND POLICE MEMBERS COOPERATE WITH CASTANO'S CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. NAVARRO WOLFF, NUMBER TWO LEADER OF M-19, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY AFTER PIZARRO WAS KILLED THAT HIS BURIAL MUST BE ATTENDED BY ALL THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE MUST REPUDIATE CRIME SUCH AS THIS. NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT PIZARRO'S DEATH SHOWS THAT THE COUNTRY IS IN TURMOIL AND THAT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY. THERE IS NO SPACE EXCEPT FOR PAIN AND FOR IRE, HE ADDED. THE BURIAL OF CARLOS MUST BE PEACEFUL, AS WAS M-19'S EXAMPLE OF PEACE GIVEN TO THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED. IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW THINGS SUCH AS THIS OCCUR WHEN THE M-19 AND CARLOS PIZARRO WERE SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF PRUDENCE, TOLERANCE, AND UNDERSTANDING, NAVARRO SAID. PIZARRO, A FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER WHO LED HIS ARMED GROUP TOWARD DEMOBILIZATION AFTER 17 MONTHS OF POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO, TOLD NEWSMEN BEFORE BOARDING THE AIRCRAFT: WE ARE DOING WELL. THIS WAS A REFERENCE TO THE M-19 ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN. PIZARRO STATED IN HIS LAST PUBLIC STATEMENT: I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL KNOW HOW TO WAGE OPPOSITION. WE WILL ENGAGE IN A VERY PRETTY DEMOCRATIC PLAY WITH REGARD TO THE NEXT GOVERNMENT. WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN BUILDING NEW COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY. THE M-19 PARTICIPATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS, BECOMING THE THIRD POLITICAL FORCE IN BOGOTA. NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID YET CONCERNING THE BURIAL OF PIZARRO, WHO WAS BORN 39 YEARS AGO IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS AND WHO LEAVES THREE ORPHAN DAUGHTERS, AGED 12, 9, AND 4.",

        "text": "COLONEL, WHAT SPECIFIC MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST THE MISSILES? (PONCE) I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN US GOOD RESULTS. THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA AREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR MISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT. WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES THAT ARE GIVING RESULTS. WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE THE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL LANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA. THANK GOD, (WORDS INDISTINCT) (REPORTER) DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE FMLN? DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS TOWARD A DIALOGUE? (PONCE) YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO TALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS. I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD. HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN AN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS REPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY. WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE FMLN. BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE INFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED AND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES. WE HAVE CONFISCATED A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS. I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25 ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12 CARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS, 45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23 RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES. I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH SUPPPORT FROM ABROAD. IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL. I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN ABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS. WE HAVE ALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL AS IN CHALATENANGO. THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW. (REPORTER) I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A LEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND ALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS. THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN PATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES. IT ALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET? IS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY? (PONCE) I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION INTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN. (CONTINUED)",

MEMBERS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY ARCE BATTALION, WHO WERE CONDUCTING AN OPERATION NEAR THE HONDURAN BORDER, RESPONDED, SUPPORTED BY TWO AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS. THE REPORT BY THE REBELS, BROADCAST FROM SAN SALVADOR BY TEGUCIGALPA RADIO AMERICA, ADDED THAT AN UNNAMED ARCE BATTALION OFFICER WAS KILLED IN THE CLASH. THE HONDURAN TROOPS THEN RETREATED TO LOS LLANITOS, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, IN HONDURAS, WHERE FOUR SALVADORAN HELICOPTERS LANDED, ACCORDING TO THE FMLN. THE REPORT ADDED THAT AS A HONDURAN HELICOPTER EVACUATED THE WOUNDED, IT WAS ATTACKED AND PURSUED 7 KM INSIDE HONDURAN TERRITORY BY A SALVADORAN AIRCRAFT FIRING ROCKETS AND MACHINEGUNS. THE HONDURAN SOLDIERS WERE SURROUNDED IN LOS LLANITOS AND TAKEN PRISONER. THE FMLN STATED THAT SEVERAL HOMES WERE DAMAGED AND THAT ANIMALS WERE KILLED IN THE SURROUNDING HAMLETS AND VILLAGES.

BOTERO SAID THAT INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANNED AND ORDERED THE ATTACK ON JARAMILLO OSSA. GEN. BOTERO TOLD REPORTERS THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CONTRACTED THE SERVICES OF AN ORGANIZATION OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND SENT THEM TO BOGOTA TO ASSASSINATE THE UP LEADER. HE ADDED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ORDERED THE DELIVERY OF AN INITIAL SUM OF 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON AFTER THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED AT EL DORADO AIRPORT'S PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS IN BOGOTA. THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THAT MINUTES AFTER THE KILLING THE DAS (ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY) INTELLIGENCE SERVICE INTERCEPTED AN ESCOBAR GAVIRIA CONVERSATION IN MEDELLIN. HE WAS ORDERING HIS ACCOMPLICES TO PAY 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON LINKED TO THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO KILLED THE UP LEADER. BOTERO ALSO DISCLOSED THAT THE ASSASSIN IS A 16-YEAR-OLD YOUTH WHO CARRIED A FALSE IDENTIFICATION CARD UNDER THE NAME OF JAIRO ALBERTO RESTREPO POSADA. MEANWHILE, ANONYMOUS CALLS WERE RECEIVED BY VARIOUS BOGOTA MEDIA TODAY. THE CALLERS WERE ATTRIBUTING THE ATTACK ON UP LEADER JARAMILLO OSSA TO A SO-CALLED GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA COMMANDO GROUP. IN THESE CALLS, IT WAS SAID THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DECIDED TO RESUME THE WAR BECAUSE FOR FIVE MONTHS IT OFFERED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT, AND THE ONLY RESPONSE IT RECEIVED WAS TO URGE CARTEL MEMBERS TO TURN THEMSELVES IN TO JUSTICE. IN ADDITION, THREATS WERE MADE AGAINST OTHER COLOMBIAN POLITICAL FIGURES SUCH AS LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATE CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO. THE CALLERS SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES RELEASED KIDNAPPED PEOPLE, DELIVERED LABORATORIES, AND LARGE QUANTITIES OF DYNAMITE AS PROOF OF THEIR INTENTION TO TALK, BUT THEY NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THE CALLERS SAID: WE ARE GOING TO TURN OURSELVES IN, BUT WE WILL BE DEAD WHEN WE DO SO. HOWEVER, BEFORE THIS HAPPENS, THEY SAID, THE COUNTRY WILL SEE THE BODIES OF ITS LEADERS, JUST AS IN THE CASE OF JARAMILLO OSSA.",

MERINO DESCRIBED THE CULPRITS AS MURDEROUS BEASTS. THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE MEDICAL-SURGICAL HOSPITAL OF THE SALVADORAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO WHICH DR GUERRERO WAS TAKEN AFTER THE ATTACK. GUERRERO, WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT TO THE DIALOGUE (COMISION DE APOYO GUBERNAMENTAL DE DIALOGO), WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TERRORISTS AT THE INTERSECTION OF BOULEVARD DE LOS HEROES AND ALAMEDA JUAN PABLO II. (BEGIN RECORDING) (MERINO) WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING IS THAT THEY ARE BENT ON CARRYING OUT TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO LOWER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE POPULATION AND TO PROVOKE GENERAL PANIC. I THINK THAT ALTHOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A CONCILIATORY POSITION TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WE MUST ALSO MAKE A FIRMER DECISION TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION. THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE WANTON ACTIONS ARE DERANGED PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WORDS. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST RESPECT A LEGAL SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OR ONE OF HUMANIZATION. THEY ARE SIMPLY BEASTS AND MURDERERS AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH. (END RECORDING) MERINO SAID THE MURDERERS MUST BE PUNISHED WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAWS, AND THAT ONE OF THE TERRORISTS WHO WAS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS UNDER INTERROGATION. (BEGIN RECORDING) (MERINO) ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WAS WOUNDED. THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY ENABLE US TO OBTAIN SOME CLUES AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE ACTUAL KILLERS AND OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THIS NEW MURDER, WHICH HAS SHOCKED SALVADORAN SOCIETY. AS IN PREVIOUS CASES, WE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS CASE. HOWEVER, I REPEAT THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO TAKE A FIRMER STAND, TO DO OUR UTMOST, AND TO REALIZE THAT IF NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO US THUS FAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL NOT FALL VICTIM TO THESE MURDERERS. IT IS BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS NOW THAN TO HAVE REGRETS LATER. (END RECORDING) MERINO SAID THAT THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY THE TERRORIST HORDES HAS NOT ENDED. CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THIS BRUTAL AND COWARDLY MURDER, WHICH HAS AGAIN FILLED THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN PEOPLE WITH SORROW.",

ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT ASSOCIATION (AEU) OF SAN CARLOS DE GUATEMALA UNIVERSITY, THE STUDENTS LEADERS DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS THREATS OF DEATH AND PERSECUTION AND DUE TO THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THE NAMES OF THE STUDENTS WHO FLED THE COUNTRY ARE BEING KEPT SECRET TO PROTECT THEIR RELATIVES WHO LIVE IN GUATEMALA CITY AND IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE SOURCES MAINTAINED. THREE OF THE STUDENTS TRAVELED TO PANAMA, ONE TO MEXICO, AND ANOTHER TO COSTA RICA. THIS MONTH, THE CORPSES OF FIVE ASSASSINATED AEU LEADERS WERE FOUND IN THE CAPITAL, SOME WITH SIGNS OF TORTURE. SIX OTHER UNIVERSITY STUDENT LEADERS REMAIN KIDNAPPED. BELISARIO POLO, STUDENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PANAMA, TODAY TOLD EFE THAT THE THREE AEU LEADERS ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY LAST WEEKEND AND ARE LIVING IN PRIVATE HOUSES. GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAID THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE HIGHEST AEU LEADERS. THE DEPARTURE OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS COINCIDES WITH THE VISIT TO GUATEMALA OF PETER KOOIJMANS, WHO YESTERDAY MET GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND ARMY OFFICERS TO GATHER INFORMATION. DURING HIS MEETING WITH GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE, KOOIJMANS REQUESTED REPORTS ON THE INVESTIGATIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONDUCTED ON THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPED STUDENTS, THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID. THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THE THREATS AGAINST OTHER AEU MEMBERS HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED BY LEADERS FROM UNIVERSITIES IN MEXICO, HONDURAS, PERU, COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, AND PANAMA. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS FROM CANADA, ECUADOR, CHILE, AND THE FRG HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY AND DEMANDED THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE THESE ASSASSINATIONAS. THE AEU REQUESTED THE HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL TO SUSPEND CLASSES FOR THE CURRENT SEMESTER IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE GUATEMALA IS SUFFERING AND IN VIEW OF THE DEATH THREATS AGAINST THE MAIN STUDENT LEADERS. AS A RESPONSE, THE CSU HAS DECIDED TO LET EACH ACADEMIC SECTION DECIDE THE STRATEGY IT WILL IMPLEMENT TO GET PROTECTION FROM THE VIOLENCE. SEVERAL OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOLS HAVE MODIFIED THE EVENING SCHEDULE, AND MOST CLASSES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO 2-HOURS PERIODS SO STUDENTS CAN RETURN HOME EARLY. SEVERAL LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION ON 15 SEPTEMBER OF EDUARDO ANTONIO LOPEZ PALENCIA, A STUDENT WHOSE CORPSE SHOWED SIGNS OF TORTURE.",

        "text": "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE FREE ELECTIONS IN A COUNTRY WHERE REPRESSION PREVAILS. IN AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT OF CLEAR FLEXIBILITY AND WILLINGNESS FOR PEACE, THE FMLN PRESENTED A PEACE PROPOSAL TO JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND. THAT PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT TURNING ELECTIONS INTO A CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE. TWO WEEKS HAVE PASSED SINCE WE PRESENTED OUR PROPOSAL, AND NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE ARMED FORCES HAVE OFFICIALLY RESPONDED TO THE FMLN INITIATIVE. THAT INITIATIVE HAS HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND OF OUR COUNTRY'S LARGEST GROUPS. NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE RESPONDED TO THE PEOPLE'S OUTCRY AND WORLD EXPECTATIONS, WHICH ARE AWAITING A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO OUR PROPOSAL. ON THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT, ITS ARMED FORCES, AND THE MEMBERS OF THEIR SQUADS DISGUISED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES CONTINUE THEIR DIRTY WAR AGAINST THE PEOPLES MOVEMENT AND THEIR WIDESPREAD WAR IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. THE NATIONAL GUARD (WORD INDISTINCT) MURDERED UNIVERSITY STUDENT MARIO FLORES, WHOSE BODY WAS LEFT ON A HIGHWAY NEAR THE PORT OF ACAJUTLA. MEANWHILE, NATIONAL POLICE MEMBERS WHO WERE DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES SEIZED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HUGO MARTINEZ AND RAUL RAMIREZ, WHO ARE STILL MISSING. JAIME ESTEVEZ, A MEMBER OF THE BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT (MPTL) WAS TAKEN TO THE USULUTAN JAIL TO BE MURDERED AND THE CRIME WAS SUPPOSED TO GO UNNOTICED. MEANWHILE, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK COOPERATIVES, FENACOA, ON 31 JANUARY, OROMONTIQUE BATTALION TROOPS OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT PACHECHO MURDERED PEASANTS VICTOR MANUEL VASQUEZ AND RAFAEL ROMERO. THE TROOPS FAKED A CLASH AT HORCONES DE BERLIN CANTON TO MURDER THOSE PEASANTS. ON 4 JANUARY, LUCIA AND MARIA ASUNCION ROMERO, AND MINOR PEDRO GONZALEZ ERAZO WERE CAPTURED AT THE AHUACHAPAN BUS STATION BY ARMY TROOPS COMMANDED BY MURDERER COLONEL CANAS. THE PEASANT COMMUNAL ASSOCIATION, ACC, CONTINUES TO DEMAND THE RELEASE OF PEASANTS BARTOLO RODRIGUEZ, WHO WAS CAPTURED ON 27 JANUARY, AND (NAME INDISTINCT) CAPTURED ON 2 FEBRUARY BY TROOPS OF COLONAL ORLANDO MONTANO OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE. THE NONGOVERNMENTAL SALVADORAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION REPORTED THE SEIZURE OF MACLOVIA GONZALEZ, VIRGILIO ORTIZ CRUZ, AND VIRGILIO ORTIZ, WHO WERE CAPTURED ON 4 JANUARY BY MILITARY DETACHMENT NO 4 TROOPS AT EL MAYUELO CANTON, MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. THEIR WHEREABOUTS ARE STILL UNKNOWN. THE MPTL ALSO REPORTED THAT ROBERTO MENA WAS CAPTURED BY ATONAL BATTALION TROOPS AT 1600 ON 5 FEBRUARY. THERE CANNOT BE FREE AND CLEAN ELECTIONS IN THIS ATMOSPHERE OF REPRESSION. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY HIGH COMMAND CONTINUE TERRIFYING AND KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE PEOPLES' WILL CANNOT BE EXPRESSED THROUGH THEIR VOTE WITH SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE OF REPRESSION, ESPECIALLY IF THE GROUPS DISPUTING POWER ARE A BUNCH OF MURDERERS AND CORRUPT MEN.",

WE MUST CALL FOR NATIONAL UNITY. WE MUST ALL COOPERATE TO SAVE OUR HOMELAND FROM THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION. WE MUST ALL UNITE TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, ALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH. WE MUST SUPPORT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, OUR INSTITUTIONS, AND WE MUST TOTALLY REJECT THE FMLN TERRORIST FORCES. WE MUST FACE THOSE FORCES THROUGH A UNITED FRONT. WE CALL ON ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL FORCES TO FORM A UNITED FRONT; TO REJECT VIOLENCE AS A WAY OF SOLVING PROBLEMS IN EL SALVADOR; AND TO UNITE IN OUR ASPIRATION TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY AND IN PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND RESPECT FOR THE LAWS. BRIEFLY, WE MUST UNITE TO LIVE IN A DE JURE STATE IN WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN HARMONY AND TRANQUILLITY. IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES JOIN EFFORTS, NOT AROUND A GOVERNMENT OR AN INSTITUTION, BUT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR DEAREST GOALS. WE ARE RECEIVING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS SUPPORTING SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY. WE HAVE RECEIVED ENCOURAGING MESSAGES FROM COUNTRIES SUCH AS GREAT BRITAIN, WHICH HAS VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTION. WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE EEC, IN WHICH THAT GROUP IS TELLING THE FMLN THAT THE ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AND THAT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, WE MUST FIRST HAVE PEACE AND THEN ACHIEVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THOSE GOALS MUST BE ATTAINED THROUGH A PEACE PROCESS. THE GOVERNMENT HAD ALREADY BEGAN THAT PROCESS AND THE FMLN TRIED TO BREAK IT. THE PEACE PROCESS MUST BE BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND ESPECIALLY ON THE TELA AGREEMENT. WE HAVE ALSO WITNESSED HOW DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL TENDENCIES HAVE BECOME UNIFIED IN OTHER COUNTRIES. (CONTINUED)",

I CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS FOLLOWERS, AND I WISH HIM SUCCESS IN HIS GOVERNMENT, FOR THE GOOD OF CHILE AND CHILEANS. HIS TRIUMPH IS NOT A DEFEAT FOR OUR IDEAS. MY CAMPAIGN WAS CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF FREEDOM -- BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC -- PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY. IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE FUTURE CHILEANS WANT, AND IF OUR IDEAS GAIN GROUND, THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NAME OF THE MAN CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THEM. BUT THOSE IDEAS MUST BE DISSEMINATED EVEN MORE WITH INCESSANT WORK. IN A DEMOCRACY, THE OPPOSITION ALSO GOVERNS. HISTORY HAS PLACED US IN THE CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS. WE WILL BE WILLING TO COOPERATE FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, BUT WE WILL STAY ALERT TO DEFEND OUR VISION OF THE FUTURE. I AM CONVINCED THAT AN INTELLIGENT OPPOSITION CAN DO MUCH FOR THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IF THAT OPPOSITION IS BACKED BY THE NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE WHO TODAY SUPPORTED MY CANDIDACY. THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD WILL TO A LARGE EXTENT BE CARRIED OUT IN CONGRESS. THE INFORMATION NOW AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT THE PACT FOR DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS HAS GAINED A VALUABLE REPRESENTATION IN BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS. LET MY CONGRATULATIONS GO TO THE FUTURE DEPUTIES AND SENATORS OF DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS. I SEIZE THIS OCCASION TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON MY SUPPORT. I AM SATISFIED WITH THE NUMBER OF VOTES I WON, CONSIDERING THE UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. I AM SATISFIED WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC AND GENEROUS WORK CARRIED OUT BY MY ELECTORAL STAFF AND BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES. I THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT. I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK EACH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR ME. TO THE MILLIONS OF CHILEAN MEN AND WOMEN WHO IN SUNSHINE OR RAIN THROUGHOUT CHILE FILLED UP STADIUMS, PLAZAS, AND STREETS, CHANTING OUT SLOGANS FOR THE FUTURE; TO THOSE WHO SAW THE STREET WITH THE SYMBOL OF THE STAR OF HOPE; TO THOSE WHO PASTED MY PICTURE ON WALLS, WINDOWS, AND NOTEBOOKS; TO THOSE WHO ENCOURAGED ME IN THIS TIRESOME BUT MOVING CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBRACE, A HANDSHAKE, OR A SMILE; TO ALL THOSE I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST THANKS. I WILL KEEP THEM IN MY HEART FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. WHEN WE INITIATED THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN -- AN HONOR THAT YOU KNOW I NEVER SOUGHT -- I TOLD MY FOLLOWERS THAT JUST LIKE CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN, THERE WERE MOMENTS OF ADVANCE, FATIGUE, AND FALLS, BUT I TRUSTED THAT, MUSTERING ALL OUR ENERGY, WE WOULD OUTDO OURSELVES AND REACH THE SUMMIT. I AM SATISFIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT EACH ONE OF US, AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A POLITICAL FORCE, HAVE OUTDONE OURSELVES AND CLIMBED A LON WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN, BATTLING FOR OUR IDEAS AND FOR VOTES. WE DID NOT REACH THE SUMMIT, TRUE, BUT THIS MUST NOT DISMAY US. TODAY WE ARE CLOSER TO THE SUMMIT THAN WHEN WE STARTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYONE. GOOD NIGHT.",

TO RESPOND TO SUCH PROPOSALS, WE REITERATE OUR WELL-KNOWN PEACE COMMITMENTS EXPRESSED IN OUR MOST SINCERE AND FRANK STATEMENTS. 3. WE FULLY SHARE THE CRITERIA EXPRESSED BY THEM REGARDING THE SURVIVAL OF THE STATE AND GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED, AGAINST ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE LIKE US, WHO HAVE SHOWN NO REGARD FOR THE LAW BY FIGHTING INSTITUTIONS AND THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED ORDER. 4. AFTER EVALUATING OUR CONDUCT UNDER THE PREVIOUS CONCEPT, WE ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND DEMOCRACY FOR OUR FATHERLAND AND FOR OUR PEOPLE. 5. AS A RESULT, WE ACCEPT THE VICTORY OF THE STATE, THE INSTITUTIONS, AND THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT. WE WILL LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS AND OTHER MEANS OF STRUGGLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS. 6. WE ACCEPT THE LEGAL ORDER THAT IS CURRENTLY IN FORCE WITH THE HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY WILL RESPECT OUR RIGHTS AND WILL ALLOW US TO RETURN TO OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. 7. AS AN ABSOLUTE PROOF OF OUR INTEREST IN ACHIEVING PEACE, WE HAVE DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY RELEASE MRS PATRICIA ECHAVARRIA AND HER DAUGHTER AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT. WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE CASES OF KIDNAPPED PEOPLE OF WHICH WE ARE ACCUSED. 8. WE OFFER OUR SERVICES AS MEDIATORS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITH THE EMERALD TRAFFICKERS, THE SO-CALLED PARAMILITARY GROUPS, AND THE SO-CALLED HIRED ASSASSINS WITH THE ONLY PURPOSE OF ENDING THE VIOLENCE THAT IS HURTING OUR COLOMBIAN FATHERLAND. 9. WE HAVE DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE SHIPMENT OF DRUGS AND TO TURN IN OUR WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, LABORATORIES, CLANDESTINE LANDING STRIPS, AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR ACTIVITIES AS SOON AS WE GET CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GUARANTEES. 10. THERE WILL BE NO MORE BOMBINGS ANYWHERE ON NATIONAL TERRITORY AND WE HAVE ORDERED THE SUSPENSION OF ALL TYPES OF EXECUTIONS OF POLITICAL LEADERS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ASSOCIATION LEADERS, JUDICIAL OFFICIALS, JOURNALISTS, POLICEMEN, AND SOLDIERS. 11. THE ESSENTIAL REASON FOR OUR STRUGGLE HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS BE OUR FAMILIES, OUR FREEDOM, OUR PEOPLE, OUR LIVES, AND OUR RIGHTS AS CITIZENS OF THIS FATHERLAND. THE EXTRADITABLES, 16 JANUARY 1990",

THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, AS AN INSTITUTION, HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THEIR DUTY AND TODAY REITERATE THEIR ABSOLUTE WILLINGNESS AND DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE BIGGEST SACRIFICE IF THIS BECOMES NECESSARY, SO THAT YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, CAN ASPIRE TO A FUTURE FULL OF HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING. WE PRAISE THE DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE. WE APPLAUD AND CONGRATULATE THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR DETERMINATION AND THE STOICISM WITH WHICH THEY, THE BRAVE SALVADORAN CITIZENS, HAVE CONFRONTED THESE MOMENTS OF TRAGEDY AND CHALLENGE. WE SAY: SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THIS INSTITUTION -- YOUR ARMED FORCES -- IS AT YOUR SIDE. THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO SHED THEIR BLOOD AND GIVE THEIR LIVES PRECISELY SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR PEOPLE, SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR CHILDREN, CAN ASPIRE TO A WORTHY, FREE, JUST, AND INDEPENDENT LIFE. WE WISH TO CONGRATULATE OUR PEOPLE FOR THEIR ATTITUDE. WE WISH TO CONGRATULATE ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BECAUSE, WITH THEIR WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT SENT TO US THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS, THE INSTITUTION FEELS STRONGER AND MORE WILLING TO DEFEND THE REAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THIS BRAVE ATTITUDE -- THIS ATTITUDE THAT REFLECTS THE REAL SALVADORANS -- IS, WITHOUT DOUBT, THE STRONGEST RESPONSE AND THE WORST PUNISHMENT THE TERRORIST FORCES COULD RECEIVE. (CONTINUED)",

(POLICE DIRECTOR) GENERAL GOMEZ PADILLA, WHO IS IN CALI, WILL TRAVEL TO BOGOTA AND WILL SOON HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THE DEATH OF THIS CRIMINAL. IN AN INTERVIEW, GEN CASADIEGO TORRADO INFORMED RCN OF THE OPERATION MOUNTED IN THE AREA WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CASADIEGO) WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THOSE OPERATING IN THAT AREA THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND THE PEOPLE WITH THEM HAVE BEEN KILLED. THAT IS THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AVAILABLE. WE DO NOT HAVE DETAILS ON THE OPERATION YET. IT WAS THE RESULT OF LONG-TERM INTELLIGENCE WORK CARRIED OUT WITH GREAT PROFESSIONALISM, WHICH GAVE US INFORMATION ON WHERE HE COULD BE FOUND. WE DEPLOYED SPECIAL GROUPS TO CARRY OUT THAT TASK. (REPORTER) GENERAL, EXACTLY WHERE DID THE OPERATION, IN WHICH RODRIGUEZ GACHA, HIS SON, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KILLED, TAKE PLACE? (CASADIEGO) IN A RURAL AREA, AS YOU KNOW, IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT LOCATION. (REPORTER) HAS IT BEEN OFFICIALLY REPORTED THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS SON WERE KILLED? IS THIS AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE? (CASADIEGO) THAT IS THE INFORMATION I HAVE. THAT IS THE INFORMATION I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT. (REPORTER) WHO ARE THE OTHER 15 PEOPLE KILLED? (CASADIEGO) WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THEM YET. OFFICIALS ARE TRAVELING TO THE SITE TO OFFICIALLY IDENTIFY THE BODIES. (REPORTER) WERE THEY ASSISTANTS, BODYGUARDS, ESCORTS? (CASADIEGO) YES, WE ARE SURE OF THAT. (REPORTER) HAVE WEAPONS OR OTHER ITEMS BEEN CONFISCATED? WE HAVE HEARD THAT IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND. (CASADIEGO) YES, WE KNOW THAT WEAPONS WERE FOUND WHICH WERE USED TO PROTECT THIS MAN. HOWEVER, AS I SAID, WE DO NOT HAVE THE DETAILS ON THE INCIDENT YET. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND HIS SON WERE KILLED, AS WELL AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE WITH HIM. (REPORTER) WHO ELSE IS THERE? IS THERE A COMMISSION OF JUDGES? WE UNDERSTAND THAT A FEW MOMENTS AGO A PLANE DEPARTED WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. (CASADIEGO) I DO NOT KNOW IF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIRECTORATE HAVE TRAVELED THERE. WE SENT POLICE INSPECTORS, JUDGES, AND WE KNOW THAT THE COMMANDERS OF THE THREE NEIGHBORING DEPARTMENTS WILL ALSO BE THERE. (REPORTER) HOW WAS THE OPERATION PLANNED, AND HAS THE PRESIDENT BEEN INFORMED? (CASADIEGO) AS I SAID, THIS OPERATION IS THE RESULT OF ARDUOUS WORK BY THE NATIONAL POLICE. IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION. FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT THESE TYPES OF OPERATIONS. WE ARE STILL DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. (CONTINUED)",

IN THIS SENSE, WE DEMAND THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES TO: 1. IMMEDIATELY CEASE REPRESSION, STOP ASSASSINATIONS, ARRESTS, USE OF TORTURE ON POLITICAL PRISONERS, SECURITY CORPS ACTIONS AGAINST DEMONSTRATIONS, STRIKES, AND OTHER PEOPLE'S ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO DEMAND THE LIFTING OF THE SIEGE AGAINST THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, LABOR UNION OFFICES, AND OFFICES OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATIONS, AND AN END TO SEARCHES AGAINST THESE ORGANIZATIONS. 2. PERMIT THE IMMEDIATE REPATRIATION OF ALL REFUGEES, WITH NO RESTRICTIONS, TO THE PLACES THEY SELECT. TO LIFT THE SIEGE AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AT THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED RESETTLEMENTS, AND ON THE CONFLICT AREAS WHERE THE ARMY PREVENTS THE ARRIVAL OF SUPPLIES. 3. CEASE THE ATTACKS ON THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN THE FORM OF ASSASSINATIONS, INTIMIDATION, AND DISMISSAL OF NEWSMEN, AND PRESSURE ON THE MEDIA IN GENERAL. 4. SUSPEND CONSCRIPTION, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT ONLY AMONG THE LOW INCOME SECTORS OF THE POPULATION. 5. STOP USING LAND MINES AND BOOBY TRAPS, WHICH HAVE CAUSED HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES ATTRIBUTED TO THE FMLN. STOP BOMBING CIVILIAN TARGETS AND INHABITED AREAS. THE FMLN, IN TURN, AGREES TO STOP ACTIONS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE GOVERNMENT'S WAR ECONOMY AND IMBALANCE THE ARMY'S DEFENSIVE SYSTEM. THE FMLN AGREES TO STOP USING SUCH WEAPONS AS THE MINES THAT HAVE INFLICTED THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES ON THE ARMY. SOME OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE AFFECTED THE POPULATION, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. WE DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT STOP USING REPRESSIVE MEASURES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE POPULATION AND THEIR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS. WE WILL NOT, HOWEVER, ACCEPT AS A GOVERNMENT GOODWILL GESTURE OUR WAR DISABLED LEAVING THE COUNTRY FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT, IF AND WHEN THIS DEPARTURE TAKES PLACE. WE REGARD THIS AS A BASIC HUMANITARIAN RIGHT SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL ACCORDS, SUCH AS THE GENEVA CONVENTION, SIGNED AND RATIFIED BY THE SALVADORAN STATE.

A OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE NOTED THAT \"MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE LEARNED THAT TERRORIST GROUPS WERE SMUGGLING SOVIET-MADE WEAPONS FROM NICARAGUA IN SPECIALLY-OUTFITTED TRAILERS TO EQUIP THE URBAN COMMANDOS AS WELL AS THE MILITIAS TO ENABLE THEM TO COMMIT TERRORIST ACTS ON 1 JUNE.\" SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI OF THE RIGHTIST NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE WILL ASSUME THIS COUNTRY'S PRESIDENCY TOMORROW; THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DEPLOYED 10,000 TROOPS FOR THE CEREMONY.",

THEY ARE AWAITING CRIMINAL INSTRUCTION JUDGES. HOWEVER, THE ELECTRICITY COMPANY WORKER MAY ANSWER QUESTIONS POSED BY STUDIO REPORTERS. LATER ON WE WILL HAVE MORE OFFICIAL INFORMATION. (STUDIO REPORTER) CAN YOU CONFIRM THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE'S BOMB SQUAD? AUTHORITIES FEAR THE CRASH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN EXPLOSION RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT INSIDE THE AIRPLANE. (REPORTER) THE F-2 JUDICIAL POLICE AND CRIMINAL STATISTICS EXPERTS ARE HERE. THEY FEEL THAT THE ACCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ACTION. THE REMARK WAS MADE BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS. THEY NOTED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK BECAUSE AIRPLANES DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF ACCIDENT UNLESS THERE IS AN EXPLOSION, SOMETHING THAT HAS VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL POLICE F-2 EXPERTS, THE AIRPLANE BROKE INTO SIX PIECES. IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, WHICH IS WHY THE 106 PASSENGERS ABOARD ARE STREWN ACROSS AN AREA 6-8 KM WIDE. ACCESS TO THE AIRPLANE'S REMAINS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS A MOUNTAINOUS REGION. THE CASQUITO (WORD INDISTINCT) IS THROUGH THE ROAD THAT GOES FROM BOSA, CUNDINAMARCA DEPARTMENT, TO THE SCHOOL (NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED). AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS AREA IS LOCATED VERY CLOSE TO SLUICE NUMBER 3, MUNA 3, WHICH FEEDS WATER TO THE DAM. THE SITUATION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DRAMATIC. RIGHT NOW, EXPERTS ARE COLLECTING SAMPLES AND TRYING FIND ALL THEY CAN TO LEARN FOR SURE IF THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACTION OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT CAUSED BY A FLAW IN THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF THE HK-1803 AIRPLANE.",

CRISTIANI SAID THAT \"THESE ARE THE RISKS FACED BY SOMEONE WHO ENFORCES THE LAW.\" HE NOTED THAT \"THE GUERRILLAS' IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE MAKES IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THEY WANT PEACE.\" ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE BECAUSE ATTORNEY GENERAL GARCIA ALVARADO WARNED THAT \"HE WOULD TAKE MEASURES AGAINST URBAN TERRORISTS.\" VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO SAID THAT WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CAR STOPPED AT A LIGHT ON A STREET IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR, AN INDIVIDUAL PLACED A BOMB ON THE ROOF OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE. \"THE DRIVER TOLD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ABOUT THE BOMB. THE VEHICLE SWERVED AND THE BOMB EXPLODED, CAUSING THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE TO COLLAPSE ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S HEAD,\" MERINO STATED. GUERRILLAS ATTACKED MERINO'S HOME IN SAN SALVADOR 5 DAYS AGO WITH EXPLOSIVES. THERE WERE SEVEN CHILDREN, INCLUDING FOUR OF THE VICE PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN, IN THE HOME AT THE TIME. A 15-YEAR-OLD NIECE OF MERINO'S WAS INJURED. \"THESE INCIDENTS,\" CRISTIANI SAID, \"FRANKLY CAUSE US TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE MUST NOT PERMIT TERRORIST ACTIONS TO OCCUR IN EL SALVADOR.\" THE PRESIDENT-ELECT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE ATTACKS \"WILL PREVENT THE INAUGURAL CEREMONY FROM TAKING PLACE.\" \"I AM CERTAIN THAT THE INAUGURATION WILL BE ON 1 JUNE. WE WILL NOT JUMP OVERBOARD OR MAKE A RUN FOR IT. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST AND WILL GO ON,\" HE STATED. CRISTIANI SAID THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS ARE INTENDED TO PROMPT A GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY REACTION SO THE FMLN CAN \"EXPLOIT IT\" ABROAD TO \"POLITICALLY ISOLATE THE NEW GOVERNMENT.\" RICARDO VALDIVIESO, PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSSEMBLY AND AN ARENA LEADER, SAID THE FMLN AND ITS \"FRONT\" GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE \"IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE THAT KILLED ATTORNEY GENERAL GARCIA.\" VALDIVIESO SAID THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WILL APPROVE DRASTIC LAWS TO \"HALT THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE.\" HE SAID THE ATTORNEY GENERAL \"WAS APOLITICAL, WORKED FOR JUSTICE, AND DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE LIKE THAT.\" ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND GARCIA ALVARADO'S DRIVER, WHO ESCAPED UNSCATHED, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS TRAVELING WITH TWO BODYGUARDS. ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S BODY WAS DESTROYED BY THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED OVER HIS HEAD. NO GROUP HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK YET, BUT POLICE SOURCES CLAIM IT \"IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FMLN URBAN COMMANDOS.\" THE SAME SOURCES CONFIRMED THAT GARCIA ALVARADO HAD BEEN THREATENED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BY SALVADORAN URBAN GUERRILLAS. MOMENTS AFTER THE ATTACK, ARMY AND POLICE UNITS CORDONED OFF THE AREA AND BEGAN AN ALL-OUT MILITARY OPERATION TO FIND THOSE RESPONSIBLE. GARCIA ALVARADO, FATHER OF SIX, WAS APPOINTED ATTORNEY GENERAL ON 23 DECEMBER 1988. HE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE CLOSELY LINKED TO ARENA. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT REPRESENT ANY PARTY AND WAS CARRYING OUT HIS JOB \"IMPARTIALLY AND WITH THE INTENTION OF ENFORCING THE COUNTRY'S LAWS.\"",

THE GOVERNMENT MUST PUT AN END TO THE DISGRACE SOME ISRAELIS CAUSE TO ALL OF US. HERE IS A REPORT BY OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT NATAN GUTMAN: (BEGIN RECORDING) THE WEEKLY CABINET SESSION DEALT WITH THE COLOMBIA ISSUE ONLY BRIEFLY. DEFENSE MINISTER YITZHAQ RABIN BRIEFLY REFERRED TO THE ISSUE MAINLY BECAUSE HE WAS ASKED BY OTHER MINISTERS TO DO SO. DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER YITZHAQ NAVON SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST PUT AN END TO THE DISGRACE CAUSED BY SOME ISRAELIS. DEFENSE MINISTER RABIN MERELY STATED THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF ISRAELIS IN COLOMBIA IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. DEFENSE ELEMENTS MADE CLEAR AT THE MEETING THAT SINCE 1986 THERE HAS BEEN A NEED TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC PERMIT FOR ANY SECURITY ACTIVITY BY AN ISRAELI BODY ABROAD. IT WAS FURTHER MADE CLEAR THAT THE HOD HAHANIT (SPEARHEAD) COMPANY DID NOT HAVE SUCH A PERMIT, AND HAS BEEN WARNED NOT TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SESSION, CABINET SECRETARY ELYAQIM RUBINSTEIN SAID THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DISASSOCIATES ITSELF FROM ANY SUCH ACTIVITY. IT WAS FURTHER STRESSED THAT ISRAEL CONSIDERS THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE PLAGUE OF INTERNATIONAL DRUGS A VERY IMPORTANT QUEST. AS FOR THE SITUATION IN THE TERRITORIES, THE DEFENSE MINISTER EXPLAINED THAT THE FEELING OF A DEADLOCKED POLITICAL PROCESS LEADS TO AN ESCALATION OF THE INTIFADAH (UPRISING). IT WAS STRESSED THAT THE MASKED MEN CREATE A REAL LEGAL PROBLEM. MINISTER SCIAKI SUGGESTED THAT ORDERS BE ISSUED TO ALLOW SHOOTING AT MASKED MEN IF SUSPICIONS WARRANT. (END RECORDING) FINANCE MINISTER SHIM'ON PERES' DRAFT LAW ON STREAMLINING BUREAUCRACY WAS APPROVED TODAY IN THE CABINET BY A LARGE MAJORITY OF 14 TO 2. SHARP EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE FINANCE MINISTER AND SOME LIKUD MINISTERS TOOK PLACE. OUR ECONOMIC CORRESPONDENT YARON KULAS REPORTS: (BEGIN RECORDING) (KULAS) THE DEBATE ON THE DRAFT LAW ON SLASHING BUREAUCRACY REOPENED THE LOUD DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FINANCE MINISTER AND LIKUD MINISTERS MOSHE NISIM, RONI MILO, AND EHUD OLMERT. ONLY TWO MINISTERS OBJECTED TO THE PROPOSAL: 'EZER WEIZMAN, WHO SAID THAT THE TRUE ECONOMIC PROBLEM TODAY IS THE INTIFADAH; AND ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MINISTER RONI MILO. (PASSAGE OMITTED) TEN MINISTERS ABSTAINED FROM VOTING. THE PLAN WAS ENDORSED, HOWEVER, BY A LARGE MAJORITY. THE KNESSET WILL CONVENE TO RATIFY THE DRAFT LAW EARLY NEXT WEEK. (END RECORDING)",

(BEGIN RECORDING) (ESTRADA) I BELIEVE IT IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES. WE ONLY KNOW THAT THEY BELONG TO AN INSTITUTION, AND THIS OF COURSE IS ONLY PARTIAL INFORMATION. (REPORTER) DID YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT LAST NIGHT, OR WAS IT A SURPRISE? (ESTRADA) I THINK IT WAS A SURPRISE BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WITH THE CRIME COMMISSION, WHICH IS THE ONE CARRYING OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS ON ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE GOVERNMENT. THEY PROMISED US THAT IF WE WERE TO COOPERATE BY PROVIDING INFORMATION, THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS. AT THAT POINT I WAS SKEPTICAL, BECAUSE THE PERSONS WHO HAVE TESTIFIED HAVE ACCUSED THE ARMED FORCES, AND I HAD NEVER SEEN A SALVADORAN PRESIDENT OR THE ARMED FORCES MAKING A SERIOUS EFFORT TO CLEAN UP ITS IMAGE AND CARRY OUT INVESTIGTIONS TO PUT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN PRISON. I WAS SKEPTICAL. I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN, BUT FACTS SHOW THAT I WAS MISTAKEN. (END RECORDING) FATHER ESTRADA HAS ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO HAVE THIS CASE INVESTIGATED, BUT HE OPTIMISTICALLY BELIEVES THAT THE DECISION TO INVESTIGATE HAS BEEN ADOPTED ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF THE PRESTIGE OF THE ARMED FORCES. (BEGIN RECORDING) (ESTRADA) I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE ARMED FORCES ARE ACTING NOT ONLY AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY COULD BE DENIED MILITARY OR ECONOMIC AID. I BELIEVE THAT A CRIME SUCH AS THE ONE BEING INVESTIGATED GOES AGAINST THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH EXISTS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, NOT TO HARM THEM. (END RECORDING) FATHER ESTRADA SAID HE TRUSTS IN THE MORAL STRENGTH OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI TO SEE THIS CASE THROUGH TO THE END. HE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT SO FAR NOTHING NEW HAS BEEN SAID AND THAT A LISTING OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND A JUST SENTENCE WOULD BE NEWS.",

WE HEREBY VOICE OUR WILLINGNESS THAT THERE BE AN IMMEDIATE IN SITU CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION AND AN OVERALL AND DEFINITIVE SIMULTANEOUS NEGOTIATION LEADING TO A NATIONAL CONSENSUS BASED ON DEMOCRATIZATION, DEMILITARIZATION OF SOCIETY, AND RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF SALVADORANS. B. IN ORDER TO HOLD GOOD NEGOTIATIONS, WE FEEL IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH IMMEDIATE GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS, AND POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS THROUGH: 1. LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE AND REPEAL OF THE LAW ON REFO THE PENAL CODES, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ANTITERRORIST LAW THAT WAS RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. 2. RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS. 3. ALLOWED DEPARTURE OF FMLN WAR DISABLED AND MEDICAL TREATMEN FMLN WOUNDED. 4. IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDERS AND OFFICER COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF, FOR HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN DECISIONS MADE BY THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS; GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLOS, GENERAL RAFAEL ANTONIO VILLAMARIONA, AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ VARELA, COMMANDER AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE AIR FORCE, FOR THEIR DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION; COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA, DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER, FOR HAVING SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS; COLONEL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE TREASURY POLICE, WHICH IS THE CORPS THAT CARRIED OUT THE MURDERS; AND CAPTAIN ALFONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA, WHO WAS THE DIRECT PERPETRATOR OF THESE MURDERS. ALL OF THESE DISMISSALS ARE NEEDED FOR THE CREDIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DECISION TO ESTABLISH GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND AS A FIRST STEP IN THE PURGE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE DISMANTLING OF THE BLOODY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP OF THE PAST 60 YEARS. 5. THE IN SITU VERIFICATION OF THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE UN WORK TEAM ON THE FORCED DISAPPEARANCES. C. WE THINK IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO REORGANIZE THE NEGOTIATING TABLE TO ENSURE THAT OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL GROUPS ARE ABLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN. THIS WILL ASSURE A NATIONAL CONSENSUS SOLUTION. MESSRS PRESIDENTS: THE SCOPE OF WAR IN OUR COUNTRY DEMANDS REALISTIC VIEWPOINTS, VIABLE AND URGENT SOLUTIONS. YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE SO THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL PREVAIL OVER WAR AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS WILL YIELD SPECIFIC RESULTS. WE REITERATE OUR APPRECIATION TO YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS, THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND, EL SALVADOR, 8 DECEMBER 1989.",

THIS WAS REPORTED BY GENERAL ALFREDO NUNEZ ALLENDE, THE CARABINEROS ORDER AND SECURITY DIRECTOR, WHO ALSO DESCRIBED THE LATEST TERRORIST ATTACKS AS ISOLATED EVENTS WHICH ARE UNDER CONTROL. (BEGIN RECORDING) (NUNEZ ALLENDE) WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE POPULATION AND OF THE FOREIGN GUESTS IN KEEPING WITH OUR DUTY REQUIREMENTS. AS FOR THE RECENT ATTACKS, I MUST SAY THEY ARE REGRETTABLE AND I WISH THEY HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE, HOWEVER, THIS KIND OF ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN ALL OUR PLANS. WE HAVE ADOPTED ALL THE MEASURES WE THINK ARE APPROPRIATE IN CASE THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY TAKES PLACE. WE WILL ALSO TRY TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF ACTION DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION SO THAT PEOPLE UNDER OUR PROTECTION WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. (UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER) WHY HAS TERRORIST ACTIVITY INCREASED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS? (NUNEZ ALLENDE) I THINK THAT THIS IS NORMAL WITHIN THE CURRENT PROCESS, IT IS NOT A SPECIFIC FACTOR OR OBJECTIVE. THE ATTACKS ARE IN KEEPING WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. (END RECORDING) THE CARABINEROS ORDER AND SECURITY CHIEF ALSO REPORTED THAT REINFORCEMENTS WILL BE BROUGHT IN TO SANTIAGO FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, AND HE ADDED THAT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER WILL NOT AFFECT THE NORMAL WORK OF THE CARABINEROS. HE ALSO SAID THAT IN FACE OF THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED. AS FAR AS HE KNEW, HE SAID, THE ARMY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN ESTABLISHING ORDER AND SECURITY DURING THE TRANSFER OF POWER CEREMONY; THIS WILL BE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHILEAN CARABINEROS. AS FOR THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS, HE SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE PART OF A PLAN, ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THAT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY HAS INCREASED LATELY. HOWEVER, SUCH ACTIONS ARE WITHIN WHAT WAS EXPECTED. HE SAID THAT THE SECURITY PERSONNEL THAT WILL BE BROUGHT IN BY THE FOREIGN GUESTS HAVE ALREADY COORDINATED THEIR ACTIONS WITH THOSE OF CARABINEROS. ON 5 MARCH, THE CARABINEROS WILL ANNOUNCE A DETAILED REPORT ON THE TRANSFER OF POWER CEREMONY AND ON THE MEASURES THAT WILL BE ADOPTED, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE CIRCULATION OF CARS. THE SECURITY PLAN WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE ONE USED DURING POPE JOHN PAUL II'S VISIT TO CHILE.",

IT REPORTS THAT AMBASSADOR BRUGUES HAD POINTED OUT THAT \"THE U.S. PHILOSOPHERS AND THEORETICIANS WHO TRIED TO THROW SOCIALISM INTO THE GARBAGE CAN OF HISTORY HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW ATTACK AGAINST CUBA.\" THE CUBAN AMBASSADOR ADDED: \"THEY INTEND TO BRING INTERNATIONAL DISCREDIT UPON CUBA AND POISON CUBA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FRATERNAL BOLIVIAN NATION, A RELATIONSHIP MARKED BY FRIENDSHIP AND MUTUAL RESPECT. TO THIS EFFECT, THEY AGAIN RESORT TO USING HYPOCRITS LIKE THE DESERTER IN QUESTION.\" BRUGUES ADDED: \"ON PRINCIPLE, CUBA HAS NOT RESORTED, AND WILL NOT RESORT, TO TERRORIST METHODS LIKE THOSE USED BY THE UNITED STATES AGAINST CUBAN LEADERS, AS STATED IN THE RECORDS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS.\" HE ADDED: \"WE REITERATE TO GEN ZENTENO ANAYA'S WIDOW AND CHILDREN, AND TO THE BOLIVIAN MILITARY MEN WHO, COMPLYING WITH THEIR MISSION, CONFRONTED \"CHE\" (GUEVARA), THAT CUBA DOES NOT HARBOR ANY RANCOUR OR HATRED. CUBA HAS NEVER ACTED, AND WILL NEVER ACT, MOTIVATED BY BASE REVENGEFUL FEELINGS.\" IN CONCLUSION, AMBASSADOR BRUGUES EXPRESSED HIS CONVICTION THAT THE BOLIVIAN-CUBAN TIES WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS SMEAR CAMPAIGN.

IN THIS SPEECH, HE URGED THE GUERRILLAS TO LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE SALVADORAN POLITICAL PROCESS. DUARTE ISSUED THIS CALL TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE FOUR COUNTRIES AND TO POPE JOHN PAUL II TO INTERCEDE WITH THE FMLN IN SUPPORT OF THE ELECTIONS. IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, THE REBELS HAVE CALLED FOR A TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE TO BEGIN ON 16 MARCH, HAVE ORDERED GAS STATION OWNERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING FUEL, HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL DESTROY POWER LINES, AND THREATENED TO KILL ELECTION OFFICIALS. ON SUNDAY, 19 MARCH, 1.8 MILLION SALVADORANS WILL CAST THEIR VOTE TO ELECT THE MAN WHO WILL REPLACE DUARTE. THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT CALLED ON THE PEOPLE TO VOTE AND SAID THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY \"WILL GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE ELECTIONS.\" FOLLOWING THE FAILURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, DURING WHICH THE REBELS PROPOSED THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE CREATION OF \"A NEW ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK,\" THE FMLN HAS ASKED THE PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE OR TO \"VOID\" THEIR BALLOTS.",

THE SOLDIERS MISTOOK THE PEASANTS, WHO WERE CIVIL SELF-DEFENSE PATROL (PAC) MEMBERS, WITH A REBEL COLUMN. ACCORDING TO THE SAME SOURCE, MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE STATED THAT THE INCIDENT, WHERE THREE PEASANTS WERE ALSO WOUNDED, HAD BEEN A \"TRAGIC MISTAKE.\" THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN NORTHEASTERN COBAN BASE TROOPS MISTOOK THE CIVILIAN PATROL FOR A REBEL COLUMN AND ATTACKED IT. THE ATTACK RESULTED IN 9 INDIAN PEASANTS KILLED AND 3 WOUNDED, INCLUDING A 17-YEAR-OLD. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COBAN FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN A PAC PATROL WAS COMBING THE AREA FOR A REBEL COLUMN THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN \"LA PROVIDENCIA\" FARMING COMMUNITY AREA. THE CIVILIAN PATROL WAS RETURNING TO ITS COMMUNITY ON 17 AUGUST, WHEN THE ARMY TROOPS, WHO WERE ALSO SEARCHING FOR THE REBEL COLUMN, FIRED AT THEM BELIEVING THEY WERE PART OF A REBEL GROUP. THE CIVILIAN PATROL UNIT, APPROXIMATELY 70 PERSONS, DID NOT FIRE BACK AT THE SOLDIERS. ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY ONE OF THE SURVIVORS, THE CIVILIANS SHOUTED AND MADE SIGNS TO THE TROOPS UNTIL, FINALLY, THE SOLDIERS REALIZED THEIR ERROR. THE SOLDIERS, HOWEVER, REALIZED THEIR MISTAKE ONLY AFTER NINE CIVILIANS HAD BEEN KILLED. GUATEMALAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO WAS QUERIED ABOUT THE INCIDENT. HE SAID IT WAS CAUSED BY \"REGRETTABLE CONFUSION\" AND THAT AN ARMY COMMAND STAFF COMMISSION HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT TO INVESTIGATE IT. GRAMAJO SAID THE COMMISSION IS TO ESTABLISH HOW THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT ADMITTED THAT INITIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THERE HAD BEEN CONFUSION BETWEEN ARMY AND PAC UNITS. THE MILITARY CHIEF SAID: \"THE INFORMATION WE HAVE UP TO NOW IS CONFUSING AS BOTH THE ARMY AND PAC HAD MOVED MEN BECAUSE THERE WERE REPORTS THAT A REBEL UNIT WAS IN THE AREA.\"",

FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT. HOWEVER, AT APPROXIMATELY 1700 TODAY A BOMB EXPLODED INSIDE A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT. A MEDIUM-SIZED BOMB EXPLODED SHORTLY BEFORE 1700 AT THE PRESTO INSTALLATIONS LOCATED ON (WORDS INDISTINCT) AND PLAYA AVENUE. APPROXIMATELY 35 PEOPLE WERE INSIDE THE RESTAURANT AT THE TIME. A WORKER NOTICED A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE UNDER A TABLE WHERE MINUTES BEFORE TWO MEN HAD BEEN SEATED. AFTER AN INITIAL MINOR EXPLOSION, THE PACKAGE EXPLODED. THE 35 PEOPLE HAD ALREADY BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE BUILDING, AND ONLY 1 POLICEMAN WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED; HE WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND BY THE SHOCK WAVE. THE AREA WAS IMMEDIATELY CORDONED OFF BY AUTHORITIES WHILE THE OTHER BUSINESSES CLOSED THEIR DOORS. IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS CAUSED; HOWEVER, MOST OF THE DAMAGE WAS OCCURRED INSIDE THE RESTAURANT. THE MEN WHO LEFT THE BOMB FLED AND THERE ARE NO CLUES AS TO THEIR WHEREABOUTS.",

HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BE OCCUPIED BY APPROXIMATELY 50 DEMONSTRATORS. AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ AND ANOTHER TWO DIPLOMATS, AS WELL AS THREE SALVADORAN TELEVISION JOURNALISTS, ARE STILL BEING HELD HOSTAGE. APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE LEFT THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY WERE LOCKED FOR 5 HOURS FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS AND SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES (FECMAFAM) OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND MURDERED AND MISSING PEOPLE. THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICIALS STILL REMAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF RIOT POLICEMEN EXPERT IN ANTITERRORIST STRUGGLE, ARMED WITH HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES. RED CROSS, GREEN CROSS, AND RELIEF COMMAND MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE EVACUATION OF THE OFFICES IN THE BUILDING. COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT \"THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES RULED OUT THE USE OF FORCE. MAURICIO SANDOVAL, DIRECTOR OF THE PRESIDENCY'S COMMUNICATIONS SECRETARIAT, WENT TO \"LA CENTROAMERICANA\" BUILDING, LOCATED IN EL SALVADOR'S BUSINESS DISTRICT, TO LEARN ABOUT THE SITUATION AND DESCRIBED THE OCCUPATION AS A \"PROPAGANDA ACT\" IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS, SCHEDULED FOR 16 AND 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), IS DRAWING CLOSER. THE FECMAFAM OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY TO PROTEST \"AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION AGAINST POPULAR ORGANIZATIONS UNLEASHED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S FASCIST GOVERNMENT,\" FECMAFAM SPOKESMEN SAID. MOST OF THOSE OCCUPYING THE EMBASSY ARE WOMEN WEARING WHITE SCARFS AND YOUTHS CARRYING WET HANDKERCHIEFS TO AVOID THE EFFECTS OF TEAR GAS. SANDOVAL DISCLOSED THAT A WORKING COMMISSION HAS BEEN FORMED TO MAINTAIN CONSULTATIONS WITH THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT \"AND IS MAKING PERTINENT CONTACTS\" TO SEEK A QUICK SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. THE OFFICIAL STRESSED: \"WE WILL NOT BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS\" WITH THE EMBASSY OCCUPIERS, WHOM, ACCORDING TO THE AMBASSADOR, ARE ARMED. THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THESE INCIDENTS, FERNANDEZ HAD A SLIGHT CARDIAC PROBLEM, BUT HAS ALREADY GOTTEN OVER IT. ACCORDING TO THIS OFFICIAL, FERNANDEZ' WIFE SENT HIM MEDICINE AND FOOD. SANDOVAL ANNOUNCED THAT AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE WILL BE ISSUED WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.",

THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE SALVADORAN MILITARY SITUATION, AND THEY ALSO CONDEMNED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).

        "text": "I BELIEVE THAT THE CLIMATE OF FLEXIBILITY IS EMBRACING THE ENTIRE POLITICAL, MILITARY, AND ECONOMIC WORLD SYSTEM AND THAT THE BANKS WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH COLLECTING LESS THAN WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. THERE WAS A TRIUMPHANT PRESENTATION OF AN OFFER TO REDUCE A COUNTRY'S DEBT BY UP TO 20 PERCENT, BUT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THAT OFFER HAS NOT MATERIALIZED. FURTHERMORE, A 20-PERCENT REDUCTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY AND THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA. THE REDUCTION MUST BE MUCH GREATER. A REDUCTION OF 10 OR 20 PERCENT WILL DO LITTLE; EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN THE SAME. WE BELIEVE -- AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS TO EVERY LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENT -- THAT ONLY THROUGH OUR ADOPTION OF FIRM AND DIGNIFIED POSITIONS WILL THE ADVERSARY RELENT. (PASSAGE OMITTED) (GARCIA) LET ME NOW SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED A TEMPEST IN A TEACUP; IT HAS RAISED AN ISSUE THAT IS OF NO RELEVANCE TO THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE. FIRST, WE UPHOLD THE CONCEPT OF UNIVERSALITY OF RELATIONS, OF MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH ALL NATIONS. COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA A FEW MONTHS AGO; HE DID NOT HAVE TO FACE A SAVAGE OPPOSITION TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS THROWING HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF TERRORISM. NOBODY HAS COMPLAINED TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ OR TO SALINAS DE GORTARI ABOUT MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. FOR THAT MATTER, NOBODY HAS OBJECTED IN BOLIVIA, AUSTRIA, OR SWEDEN, BECAUSE IN THOSE COUNTRIES THERE IS NO REACTIONARY RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT TO RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA IS TO COURT DESTRUCTION. SECOND, SOMEONE -- AND I DO NOT WANT TO MENTION HIM BY NAME -- HAS SAID THAT RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH A TERRORIST STATE. THIS IS A TREMENDOUS ERROR, BECAUSE 20,000 RIFLES SOLD TO US BY NORTH KOREA AT $90 APIECE -- $10 LESS THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD -- HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SAVE AND DEFEND THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIAN GUARDS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE AND ERADICATE SUBVERSION IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THIRD, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE AUCTIONED OFF TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. IF SO WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA OR WITH FINLAND. ONE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD. UNDER SUCH CRITERIA, SINCE PERU RECOGNIZES THE FRG, IT SHOULD CLOSE ITS EMBASSY IN THE COMMUNIST GDR. THIS MANICHEAN CRITERION, THIS OBTUSE CRITERION, THIS OUTMODED CRITERION IS NO LONGER VALID; THE BERLIN WALL HAS BEEN RAZED. HOW CAN ONE SAY THAT THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ANOTHER SHOULDN'T? PERU WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY IMPERIALIST VETO ON ITS WORLD RELATIONS. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE 1960'S AND 1970'S WHEN PASSPORTS SAID WE COULD NOT TRAVEL TO THE SOVIET UNION OR CUBA. PERUVIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL WHEREVER THEY WISH, LIKE THEY WISH, AND WHEN THEY WISH. THIS IS FREEDOM, AND IT CANNOT BE CURTAILED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OFF-LIMITS AREAS AROUND THE GLOBE. FINALLY, SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO NOW OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA HAVE BEEN HONORED, ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS OF THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT. THE OTHER DAY I HEARD SOME PEOPLE SPEAKING VEHEMENTLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHILE SOME OTHER PEOPLE NEARBY HAD BEEN HONORED GUESTS THERE. JOURNALISTS CAN SEEK OUT AND DETERMINE HOW MANY OF THOSE WHO NOW OPPOSE THESE RELATIONS HAVE BEEN HONORED GUESTS IN NORTH KOREA FOR WEEKS. NOW, FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. (END RECORDING)",

        "text": "MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SAID TODAY THAT PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S MESSAGE REVEALING THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE SIX JESUITS' SLAYING REPRESENTS \"A DECISIVE TURN TOWARD THE END OF IMPUNITY\" IN THE COUNTRY. ROSA CHAVEZ SAID IN HIS SUNDAY HOMILY THAT \"THIS HAS AUGMENTED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO RECOVER THEIR TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT'S INSTITUTIONS.\" NEVERTHELESS, IN A STATEMENT GIVEN LATER TO THE MEDIA, THE AUXILIARY BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE IMPLICATED MILITARY \"DO NOT REPRESENT ISOLATED CASES OF PERSONS WHO VIOLATED THE NORMS OF AN INSTITUTION, BUT ARE ACTUALLY PART OF A FORMATION AND THOUGHT SCHEME ACCORDING TO WHICH THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS SOMETHING SUBVERSIVE.\" ACCORDING TO ROSA CHAVEZ, \"THE MILITARY WORLD WRONGLY UNDERSTANDS THE CHURCH'S MISSION IN THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.\" \"ASKED ABOUT EVENTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES NOT SPECIFIED BY THE PRESIDENT, ROSA CHAVEZ ANSWERED: \"THIS GRAVE ACTION IS THE RESULT OF A CONSPIRACY--AT LEAST A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE.\" HE EMPHASIZED THAT, CONSEQUENTLY, THE STEP TAKEN YESTERDAY BY THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT \"IS VERY IMPORTANT, EVEN IF IT IS NOT THE LAST ONE.\" THE BISHOP RECALLED THAT THIS YEAR IS THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S ASSASSINATION, \"WHICH HAS YET TO BE SOLVED,\" AND ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT \"ALL THE LEGAL ACTIONS TO INVESTIGATE THE CASES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHOSE LIVES WERE TAKEN BY GUERRILLA GROUPS OR THE ARMY.\" ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT THE CHURCH FULLY AGREES THAT THE CRIMES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED \"WITH THE SAME ZEAL\" WITH WHICH THE JESUIT PRIESTS' SLAYING HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED. \"HOWEVER, WE HAVE ASKED THAT THE INVESTIGATION BE EXHAUSTIVELY AND THOROUGHLY CARRIED OUT WITHOUT GIVING IT A PROPAGANDISTIC APPEARANCE,\" HE ADDED. THE BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE TWO IDEOLOGIES CONFRONTING EACH OTHER IN EL SALVADOR EQUALLY DISDAIN HUMAN RIGHTS. \"MARXISM IS THE ROOT OF THE FMLN'S ABUSE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY DOCTRINE REPRESENTS THE BASIS OF THE ARMED FORCES' UNACCEPTABLE REPRESSION,\" HE SAID.",

        "text": "THE MAIN REASON FOR COMING UP WITH THIS VERSION WAS TO (WORDS INDISTINCT) MASTERMINDS OF THE CRIME (WORDS INDISTINCT) TO FIND OUT WHO THE PERPETRATORS WERE. WITH THIS VERSION, CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE TRIAL AND TO PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS ON MID-LEVEL MILITARY OFFICERS. THE COLONELS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE CRIME COULD BE SET FREE AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WOULD ONLY BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED WITHIN AN AREA UNDER THEIR COMMAND. THIS VERSION OF THE CRIME IS AIMED AT LEAVING THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND FREE FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND TO ONLY SLIGHTLY TOUCH THE MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA, ESPECIALLY COL ORLANDO CEPEDA, WHO WAS THE ONE WHO SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUITS, AND COL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF STAFF. COL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, WHO IS A MEMBER OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE WITHIN LA TANDONA, WAS INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE CRIME. HOWEVER, THE (WORD INDISTINCT) IS SELF-EVIDENT. THE DECISION TO CARRY OUT AN OPERATION TO KILL POPULAR AND RELIGIOUS DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WAS MADE BY THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES (WORDS INDISTINCT) 4 DAYS AFTER THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BEGAN. THIS OPERATION WAS PART OF A COMPLETE COUNTEROFFENSIVE PLAN OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH INCLUDED THE MASSIVE USE OF ALL THE FIREPOWER OF THE AIR FORCE AGAINST POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE KILLING OF DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND CHURCH LEADERS. ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO WAS TAKEN TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE GENERAL STAFF FOR SECURITY REASONS AND ASSUMED CONTROL OF THE DEFENSE PLAN, WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE GENOCIDE PLAN. U.S. OFFICERS AND ADVISERS WERE ALSO AT THE GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS AT THE TIME TO DISCUSS AND APPROVE THIS GENOCIDE PLAN. THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED ON THE EVENING OF 16 NOVEMBER. ALL LABOR UNION OFFICES IN SAN SALVADOR WERE LOOTED. THE OFFICES OF HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, POLITICAL PARTIES, AND RELIGIOUS CENTERS WERE ALSO LOOTED. THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED AT THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE UCA. THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED SAW A CONTINUATION OF THE ARRESTS, PERSECUTIONS, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THE OFFICES OF ALL THE (WORDS INDISTINCT) WERE ATTACKED. ITS LEADERS WERE FORCED TO SEEK REFUGE OR TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO ESCAPE THIS MANHUNT. THIS IS A POLICY FOR WHICH THE HIGH COMMAND AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE. (WORDS INDISTINCT) THE U.S. AMBASSADOR AND U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL ARE FULLY AWARE OF THIS. THE NEED TO COME UP WITH THIS VERSION COMES FROM THE PRECARIOUS PREDICAMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN IN VIEW OF THE DEBATES TAKING PLACE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS TO DECIDE THE FATE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS LINKED TO THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS ON 16 NOVEMBER.",

MONTERIA IS THE CAPITAL OF CORDOBA DEPARTMENT AND IT IS LOCATED 490 KM NORTH OF BOGOTA. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MONTERIA POLICE ADVISED AFP VIA TELEPHONE THAT THE FRONT PART OF THE PLANE, AS WELL AS THE COCKPIT, WERE BURNED WHEN A BOMB, PLANTED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS, EXPLODED. NO VICTIMS WERE REPORTED. THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BOGOTA CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE WAS \"SERIOUSLY DAMAGED\" BY THE FLAMES; HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY DID NOT SPECIFY THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE. ACCORDING TO EMBASSY SPOKESMAN PETER SAMSON, THE PLANE IS THE PROPERTY OF THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS MATTERS (INM). THE PLANE, WHICH WAS RETURNING TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER FULFILLING A MISSION IN PERU, HAD BEEN PARKED AT THE MONTERIA AIRPORT FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS. THE PLANE WAS FORCED TO LAND IN MONTERIA AFTER ONE OF ITS ENGINES FAILED, THE EMBASSY SPOKESMAN ADDED. ACCORDING TO THE MONTERIA POLICE, THE FIRE BROKE OUT AFTER AN EXPLOSION WAS HEARD. THE FIREMEN INTERVENED QUICKLY TO PREVENT THE FIRE FROM SPREADING AND COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE PLANE. THE FIRE BROKE OUT AT 0430 (0930 GMT), A FEW HOURS BEFORE TWO C-130 PLANES--U.S. MILITARY CARGO PLANES--ARRIVED AT BOGOTA AIR FORCE BASE WITH MILITARY MATERIEL SENT TO HELP FIGHT THE BATTLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING LAUNCHED BY THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES.",

        "text": "ATTENTION: A REPORT FROM SAN SALVADOR STATES THAT FIGHTING CONTINUES IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE CITY. OUR FORCES ARE FINDING LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM THE SO-CALLED TROOPS BROUGHT FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY. THE REPORT STATES THAT DURING TODAY'S CLASHES IN CIUDAD DELGADO, LOS ALPES, GUADALUPE, AND SAN PATRICIO NEIGHBORHOODS, THE TREASURY POLICE SUFFERED THREE CASUALTIES. WE INFLICTED TWO CASUALTIES ON THE TREASURY POLICE IN LOS ALPES NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE 6TH MILITARY DETACHMENT SUFFERED ONE CASUALTY DURING A CLASH IN SAN PATRICIO NEIGHBORHOOD. IT HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) FORCES HAVE SET UP BARRICADES ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD AND POWER LINES HAVE BEEN SABOTAGED. AS A RESULT OF THIS SABOTAGE, AN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR DOES NOT HAVE POWER. WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT TWO TRANSFORMERS WERE DESTROYED ON KM 10 OF THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD, WHERE BARRICADES WERE ALSO SET UP. THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE ENEMY SHOWED UP 90 MINUTES AFTER THE BARRICADES HAD BEEN SET UP AND HEAVY FIGHTING RESULTED. THE ENEMY TROOPS SUFFERED FOUR CASUALTIES; OUR FORCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD. AT THIS HOUR, 1613 (2213 GMT), THE REBEL PRESENCE IN INCREASING ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD. ATTENTION: DURING YESTERDAY'S ATTACK, WITH PEOPLE'S ARTILLERY ON 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE TROOPS, WE INFLICTED EIGHT CASUALTIES. THESE EIGHT CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED. AT NOON TODAY, CLASHES WITH 1ST MILITARY DETACHMENT TROOPS WAS REPORTED IN LA CRUZ HILL, SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES JURISDICTION. WE REPEAT: TODAY AT NOON, FIGHTING WAS REPORTED IN LA CRUZ HILL, SAN MIGUEL DE MERCEDES, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THIS HAS BEEN THE LATEST REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED. THERE IS FIGHTING IN CIUDAD DELGADO, LOS ALPES, GUADALUPE, SAN PATRICIO, AND OUR GUERRILLA COLUMNS ARE SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY. IT IS NOW 1615 (2215 GMT) AND THE HIGH COMMAND HAS NOT REACTED. THIS GIVES US AN IDEA OF HOW LOW MORALE IS AMONG THE SOLDIERS IN SAN SALVADOR. THIS NEW BLOW AGAINST THE ENEMY FORCES IN SAN SALVADOR HAS CAUSED THE MORALE OF THE ENEMY FORCES TO DROP EVEN FURTHER. ATTENTION: WE HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A REBEL AMBUSH IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF SAN SALVADOR. THE REPORT ADDS THAT AT 0630 (1230 GMT) TODAY, REBEL FORCES AMBUSHED A VEHICLE TRANSPORTING NATIONAL GUARDSMEN. THE AMBUSH OCCURRED ON KM 9.5 ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD. THE GUARDSMEN WERE HEADING INTO AN AREA WHERE THE FMLN REBELS HAVE SET UP BARRICADES. A POWERFUL GUAZAPA-TYPE MINE AND RIFLES WERE USED IN THE AMBUSH. AT LEAST 10 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING A NATIONAL GUARD OFFICER, WERE INFLICTED. WE REPEAT: A NATIONAL GUARD OFFICER IS INCLUDED AMONG THE CASUALTIES WE INFLICTED DURING THIS AMBUSH CARRIED OUT ON KM 9.5 ON THE NORTHERN TRUNK ROAD. LIKEWISE, WE HAVE LEARNED THAT FIGHTING CONTINUES IN MEJICANOS, AYUTUXTEPEQUE, CIUDAD DELGADO, AND SOYAPANGO. HEAVY FIGHTING IS ALSO BEING REPORTED IN APOPA AND MARIONA. REBEL FORCES ARE SPREADING OUT THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN AREA OF SAN SALVADOR AND THEY ARE FINDING LITTLE RESISTANCE. AT 1616 (2216 GMT), THIS HAS BEEN THE REPORT RECEIVED AT RADIO VENCEREMOS. WE ARE RECEIVING REPORTS FROM OUR LIBERATED TERRORITORIES, FROM CHALATE (CHALATENANGO), MORAZAN, SAN MIGUEL. GREETINGS TO OUR FORCES IN SAN SALVADOR; ONWARDS FIGHTING COMRADES; OUR PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING YOU IN SAN SALVADOR.",

EL ESPECTADOR SAID THAT \"RUMORS OF A POSSIBLE CABINET RESHUFFLE GREW, AND IT WAS FULLY CONFIRMED THAT JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF HAD RESIGNED AND WILL STAY FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD IN THE UNITED STATES.\" A JUSTICE MINISTRY SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE NEWSPAPER REPORT, BUT A POLITICAL SOURCE OF THE RULING PARTY TOLD REUTER HE HAD HEARD THE MINISTER WAS GOING TO RESIGN. ANOTHER SOURCE SAID GREIFF WILL STAY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 12 DAYS AND THAT SHE WILL TENDER HER RESIGNATION UPON HER RETURN. GREIFF, WHO WAS APPOINTED ON 16 JULY, WAS ASKED BEFORE LEAVING THE COUNTRY IF SHE WAS A WARTIME OR PEACETIME MINISTER. SHE REPLIED: \"I AM A PEACETIME MINISTER.\" LOCAL NEWS MEDIA AND POLITICAL SECTORS INTERPRETED THIS COMMENT AS AN ADVANCED NOTICE OF HER RESIGNATION.",

        "text": "GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO HAS PRESENTED TO THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT A PROPOSAL TO RESTRUCTURE THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT. THE PROPOSAL COVERS THE SUPPLY OF OIL AND THE SALE OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. ANOTHER POINT INCLUDED IS THE REFINANCING OF THE GUATEMALAN DEBT WITH VENEZUELA, WHICH TOTALS $200 MILLION. THE GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT'S ACTIVITIES BEGAN TODAY AT MIRAFLORES PALACE WHEN, PRIOR TO THE SIGNING OF THE TWO AGREEMENTS, THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HELD A PRIVATE MEETING WITH HIS GUATEMALAN COUNTERPART. THE PRESIDENTS THEN HELD A FORMAL WORK SESSION WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF TWO COMMISSIONS AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL. GUATEMALA, LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT, ARE FACING THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HONOR ALL COMMITMENTS ON DEBTS AS THEY MATURE. THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. (BEGIN RECORDING) (CEREZO) WE HAVE PROPOSED A 20-YEAR TERM TO RESTRUCTURE THE DEBT, WITH A SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT FOUR PERCENT INTEREST. OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE USUAL PROCEDURE AT THE VENEZUELAN INVESTMENT FUND NOR IS THIS INCLUDED IN THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT. FOR THESE REASONS, BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT FIT VENEZUELAN LAW, WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND ADJUST THE TERMS TO THE LAW AND THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, THERE IS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THE TERMS. WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME PROPOSAL TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, FROM WHOM WE EXPECT THE SAME ATTITUDE AND UNDERSTANDING, AND WE ARE CERTAIN WE WILL HAVE IT. (END RECORDING) WITHIN THE FORMAL CEREZO VISIT, TWO IMPORTANT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND GUATEMALA WERE SIGNED TODAY. ONE OF THEM IS A COOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP AGREEMENT. ANOTHER IS A SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT IN ENERGY AND MINING MATTERS, WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN BILATERAL RELATIONS. AS ENERGY AND MINES MINISTER CELESTINO ARMAS SAID UPON SIGNING THE AGREEMENTS, THIS WILL PERMIT CARRYING OUT JOINT OIL EXPLORATION OPERATIONS. (BEGIN RECORDING) (ARMAS) FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF OIL EXPLORATION, THERE ARE VERY INTERESTING PROSPECTS IN GUATEMALA THAT COULD RESULT IN GREAT INTEREST FOR GUATEMALA AND FOR VENEZUELA.

        "text": "AT THE END OF 1989 AND AT THE BEGINNING OF 1990, THE UNITED STATES CONDUCTED TWO MAJOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA, TO THE UNANIMOUS CONDEMNATION OF THE NATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. HOWEVER, THE FIGHTERS FOR \"FREEDOM,\" \"DEMOCRACY,\" AND \"HUMAN RIGHTS\" IN WESTERN NATIONS HAVE KEPT QUIET OUT OF FEAR OF THE NAKED AGGRESSION AND THE WAY OF THE TYRANT. ON 20 DECEMBER 1989, SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF U.S. TROOPS, EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST UP-TO-DATE WEAPONS, BRAZENLY INTRUDED INTO PANAMA, TOPPLING THE NORIEGA GOVERNMENT AND FORCING MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA TO BE TRIED IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS U.S. ACT WAS BY NO MEANS LESS THAN THE SOVIET ACT OF INVADING CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND KIDNAPPING ITS LEADERS AT THAT TIME. THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ESTIMATED THAT THE U.S. INVASION HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 600 PANAMANIAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AND MADE SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS. MORE THAN 5,000 MILITARY AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT WERE ARRESTED BY U.S. TROOPS, AND PANAMA SUFFERED ECONOMIC LOSSES OF $10 BILLION. THE UNITED STATES OPENLY MANIPULATED THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL DEFENSE ARMY, POLICE FORCE, AND OTHER STATE APPARATUSES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUSHED IN AND RAIDED (AS PUBLISHED) THE EMBASSIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN PANAMA OR DIPLOMATIC APARTMENTS, AND DETAINED THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. UNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF WORLD OPINION, SOME OF THE U.S. TROOPS HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM PANAMA, BUT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO PULL OUT ALL ITS TROOPS. JUST AFTER ITS INTRUSION INTO PANAMA, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED, AS SCHEDULED, THE DISPATCH OF A STRONG FLEET OF WARSHIPS INTO THE CARIBBEAN, CLOSE TO THE COAST OF COLOMBIA, FOR WHAT WAS CALLED AN ANTIDRUG MANEUVER, INTERCEPTING PLANES AND VESSELS FOR TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS. ON 5 JANUARY THIS YEAR, THE UNITED STATES, IGNORING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, ORDERED A FLEET OF FOUR WARSHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER \"KENNEDY\" AND NUCLEAR-PROPELLED CRUISER \"VIRGINIA,\" TO SAIL TOWARD THE CARIBBEAN TO \"COMBAT DRUG SMUGGLING.\" SUCH A HIGH-HANDED WAY OF IGNORING THE SOVEREIGNTY AND WILL OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS AND FORCING THE DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN FRONT OF THE GATES OF OTHER COUNTRIES EVOKED FIERCE REACTIONS IN COLOMBIA AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS. JARAMILLO OSSA, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC UNION, NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES \"VERY NEARLY\" INVADED COLOMBIA. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WARNED THE U.S. GOVERNMENT: WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BARCO, NO U.S WARSHIPS ARE ALLOWED TO DRAW NEAR (AS PUBLISHED) THE WATERS OF COLOMBIA. IT ALSO ORDERED ITS NAVAL AND AIR FORCES TO INTENSIFY THEIR SEA PATROLS TO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENTS OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND SOME OTHER NATIONS REFUSED TO JOIN THE PROPOSED U.S. \"DRUG-FIGHTING DRILL\" IN THE CARIBBEAN. FACED WITH SUCH A SITUATION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD TO ORDER THE \"DRUG-FIGHTING FLEET\" TO RETURN TO BASE AND CANCEL THE \"DRILL.\" ON THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTS OF THE UNITED STATES, LEADERS OF SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS COMMENTED: WHILE RELAXING THE TENSION WITH THE SOVIET UNION, THE UNITED STATES HAS RESERVED THE \"RIGHT\" TO INTERFERE BY FORCE IN LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER SMALL AND WEAK COUNTRIES. THE PUBLIC MEDIA OF SOME NATIONS SOLEMNLY POINTED OUT: SUCH MOVES OF U.S. AGGRESSION ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONSISTENT U.S. POLICY OF INTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF LATIN AMERICA AND ALSO THE EXTENSION OF WHAT IS CALLED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 1980'S. IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE DECADE OF THE 1980'S, THERE WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING THE SITUATION AS A WHOLE, NAMELY, THE ISSUE OF CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LISTED IN THE CATEGORY OF EAST-WEST CONFRONTATION BY THE UNITED STATES. THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION EVEN GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO MEETING THE CRISIS IN CENTRAL AMERICA IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY. IN 1981, WHEN REAGAN ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA STOOD AS FOLLOWS: THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION HAD WON VICTORY IN NICARAGUA, THE GUERRILLA WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS ESCALATING, AND A TURBULENT SITUATION HAD STARTED TO EMERGE IN OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIPLOMACY PURSUED BY THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION RESULTED IN THE DETERIORATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS RULED BY JUNTAS. IN 1977 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION SIGNED THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WITH THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AGREEING TO RETURN TO PANAMA SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE CANAL AND THE CANAL ZONE. BEFORE THE VICTORY OF THE NICARAGUA REVOLUTION, IN 1979 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE TYRANNICAL SOMOSA REGIME AND ESTABLISHED NORMAL RELATIONS WITH THE SANDINISTA REGIME.

AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAS BEEN COUNTERED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND POSSESSIONS. THE SITUATION IS UNDER THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' CONTROL. THE FLMN, WITH A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, HAS UNLEASHED AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK ON VARIOUS PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR AND ON THE CAPITALS OF FOUR DEPARTMENTS BY FIRING VERY POWERFUL WEAPONS AND KILLING MANY CIVILIANS. THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY REPORTS THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE THE FMLN ATTACKS ON MILITARY OBJECTIVES HAVE SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS. THIS FMLN ATTACK IS TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED BECAUSE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTENDED THEM WITH TOTAL POLITICAL HONESTY, TRYING TO FIND MECHANISMS AND RATIONAL SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT. THE FMLN NOT ONLY HAS VIOLATED THE AGREEMENTS IT SIGNED IN MEXICO CITY, BUT ALSO IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. IT HAS ALSO BRAZENLY MOCKED THE FEELINGS AND THE DESIRE FOR PEACE WANTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTIONS HAVE FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE USE OF ITS LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFEND SOCIETY BY USING THE ARMED FORCES WHICH HAS BEEN FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THEIR LIBERTY AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF TOTALITARIAN MARXIST-LENINIST SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ONE THE FMLN WANTS TO IMPOSE RUTHLESSLY. REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHO HAVE OBSERVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE INCIDENTS CAN FULLY CONFIRM THE FACTS. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN ADDITION TO BEING VICTIMS OF THE FMLN AGGRESSION, FEEL OUTRAGED BECAUSE THE FMLN STILL HAS THE GALL TO SAY THAT IT IS SPEAKING IN DEFENSE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO, IN THESE SAD TIMES, FEEL OUTRAGED BY THE TERRORIST GROUP'S IRRATIONAL ATTACK. THE GOVERMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR REQUESTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONDEMN THIS BRUTAL VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS PERPETRATED BY THE FMLN. IT ALSO ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THE HIDEOUS CRIMES THE FMLN TROOPS ARE PERPETRATING AGAINST CIVILIANS -- WHO FLATLY REFUSE TO HELP THEM -- AND WHO HAVE REJECTED THEM (3 SECOND BREAK IN TRANSMISSION).

        "text": "DIE WELT: YOUR THOUGHTS ARE FOCUSED ON CHILE, BUT LET US BRIEFLY LOOK AT EUROPE NEVERTHELESS. THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN EAST EUROPE HAS ALSO BEEN A SENSATION TO CHILE. WHAT HOPES DO YOU PLACE IN THESE GIGANTIC RADICAL CHANGES? AYLWIN: I THINK THAT THE CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE ARE OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR MANKIND. THEY GIVE US SATISFACTION AND HOPE. THE OPENING OF THE BERLIN WALL SYMBOLIZES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN RELATIONS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AS WELL AS THE DESIRE OF THE GERMANS TO ACHIEVE UNITY AGAIN. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS SITUATION LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN MILITARY SPENDING AND TO CLOSER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PEOPLES. DIE WELT: WHAT EFFECTS DO YOU SEE FOR A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY SUCH AS CHILE? AYLWIN: I SEE TWO EFFECTS. FIRST, A SYMBOLIC EFFECT. CHILE IS TRADITIONALLY A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY. NOW THE LONG PERIOD OF A DICTATORIAL REGIME IS ENDING, HOWEVER. THIS EXPLOSION OF FREEDOM COINCIDES WITH THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE. THAT IS A STIMULATING FEELING. WE ARE EMBARKING ON THE ROAD OF HUMANITY. SECOND, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE DANGER OF COMMUNISM IN OUR COUNTRY; PEOPLE SAY THAT COMMUNISM COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR DEMOCRATIC FUTURE. I THINK THAT THE EVENTS IN EAST EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNION DEMONSTRATE THAT COMMUNISM IS NO LONGER A DANGER FOR THE WORLD. NOR FOR CHILE. DIE WELT: CHILE HAS THE BEST ORGANIZED COMMUNIST PARTY IN LATIN AMERICA. HAS THIS PARTY CHANGED? WHAT WAS ITS REACTION? AYLWIN: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATION OF SUCH A MONOLITHIC AND COHERENT PARTY. IT WAS ILLEGAL AND WORKED UNDERGROUND FOR A LONG TIME. HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COMMUNIST PARTY CAN IGNORE THE EVENTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DOMINATED BY COMMUNIST PARTIES. THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS HAVE ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROCESS. DIE WELT: WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE WITH VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY? DO YOU SPEAK WITH HIM? DO YOU SEE HIM SOMETIMES? AYLWIN: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BOTH SENATORS, MEANING PRIOR TO 1973. WE WERE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT WE OFTEN TALKED WITH EACH OTHER. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE MET ONLY ONCE, AT A POLITICAL FUNCTION. MY RIVALS IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE OFTEN MISREPRESENTED OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS TEITELBOIM'S SECRET ALLY. HOWEVER, I THINK THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSUASIONS CAN TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN REACH AGREEMENT. THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN CHILE WITH SOME SUCCESS. DIE WELT: THE COMMUNIST PARTY BACKED YOUR CANDIDACY. WILL IT BE REPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT? AYLWIN: NOT AT ALL. DIE WELT: BUT THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL BE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT AND WILL REFLECT THE COMPOSITION OF THE OPPOSITION TODAY. AYLWIN: YES, CHILE WILL HAVE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT. THE VARIOUS SOCIALIST CURRENTS WILL BE REPRESENTED. HOWEVER, THE STRONGEST MOVEMENT IS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS IN THE CENTER. DIE WELT: DO YOU THINK THAT FOLLOWING THESE ELECTIONS, THE PANORAMA OF THE OPPOSITION WILL CHANGE? AYLWIN: I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR FAMILIES IN THE PAST -- THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FAMILY, THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATICALLY-ORIENTED FAMILY OF THE OLD RADICAL PARTY, THE SOCIALIST FAMILY, AND THE FAMILY OF THE RIGHT CENTER. THEY ALL WANT TO SURVIVE. DIE WELT: MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST RICARDO LAGOS IS THE STRONGEST FIGURE OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE. WHAT ROLE WILL HE PLAY IN THE FUTURE? AYLWIN: HE WILL CONCENTRATE ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK AS A SENATOR. AS IS THE CASE IN EVERY PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, HE CANNOT BE A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF CONGRESS. (CONTINUED)",

A PRESIDENTIAL PALACE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES DISCUSSED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO SOME OF THE ISSUES TO BE DEBATED AT THE \"WORKING ROUNDTABLES.\" THE \"WORKING ROUNDTABLES\" COMPRISE DELEGATES OF THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS, WHO WILL EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THE CHANGES THE COUNTRY NEEDS. THE M-19 DELEGATES ARRIVED AT THE NARINO PALACE, LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA, UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES AT 1800 LOCAL TIME (2300 GMT). MEANWHILE, AT THE PEACE VILLAGE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CAUCA DEPARTMENT, 350 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA, M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ RELEASED A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH HE ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN ARMY OF ATTACKING AN M-19 GROUP ON 26 MARCH. ACCORDING TO PIZARRO, THE ATTACK WAS STAGED BY THE MILITARY TO \"CREATE OBSTACLES FOR THE PEACE PROCESS.\" HE ADDED THAT COMMANDER MARCO CHALITA, COMMANDER OF THE M-19'S \"SOUTHERN FRONT,\" WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED IN THE FIGHTING. ON 26 MARCH, 9TH BRIGADE TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE \"AMANDA RINCON\" GROUP, LED BY CHALITA, IN A RURAL AREA OF PITALITO MUNICIPALITY, HUILA DEPARTMENT. DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL MANUEL JAIME GUERRERO PAZ DESCRIBED THE CLASH AS \"AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT.\" PIZARRO SAID IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE PEACE VILLAGE TODAY THAT THE TROOPS ATTACKED THE REBELS AND THAT \"TWO OF OUR COMRADES WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS WOUNDED.\" THE M-19 COMMANDER SAID \"HE SHARED THE DEFENSE MINISTER'S VIEWPOINT,\" AND HE SAID \"OBSTACLES STILL MUST BE OVERCOME\" TO ACHIEVE A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. THE M-19 BEGAN TALKS WITH THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY. FOLLOWING A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT BARCO'S ENVOYS, THEY AGREED ON THE CREATION OF \"ROUNDTABLES.\" LAST WEEK, THE M-19 AND GOVERNMENT MINISTER RAUL OREJUELA MET AT THE PEACE VILLAGE, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS PRESENTED THE NAMES OF THE DELEGATES THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE AT THE \"ROUNDTABLES,\" WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN DELIBERATIONS ON 3 APRIL.",

SOME MEASURES THAT HAVE AFFECTED INCOME HAVE BEEN ADOPTED, BUT WE WILL MAKE PROGRESS ANYHOW. (GIRON) WILL YOU ASK THAT SOME OF THESE LAWS BE RECONSIDERED? (AZCONA) NO, I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT. THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE LAW ON COFFEE TAXES WHICH COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH PRODUCERS BECAUSE THE LAW-DECREE ON COFFEE IS VERY DRASTIC. HOWEVER, THE COUNTRY IS MAKING PROGRESS, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN VARIOUS SECTORS--COMMERCE, CONSTRUCTION, AND MANUFACTURING--ARE ON THE INCREASE. SOME SECTORS HAVE SOME PROBLEMS, BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RESOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS. (GIRON) DO YOU HAVE ECONOMIC ADVISERS, MR PRESIDENT? (AZCONA) ANY PERSON CONSULTED IS AN ECONOMIC ADVISER. THE MAIN ECONOMIC ADVISERS, HOWEVER, ARE THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT. (GIRON) IT IS BEING SAID THAT POLITICALLY SPEAKING YOU HAVE BEEN LEFT ON YOUR OWN. IS THIS HOW YOU SEE IT ALSO? (AZCONA) NO WAY. HOW COULD I BE ALONE? ON THE CONTRARY, WE ARE DOING WELL. I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RECEIVE MORE SUPPORT. I DO NOT SEE WHY I COULD BE LEFT ALONE. THERE IS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE EXPERTS. WE ARE ESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH THE PARTY, WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE OF THE PARTY. (GIRON) ARE EMPLOYEES GOING TO BE PRESSURED? (AZCONA) I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE NO LAW SAYS THAT THE EMPLOYEES OF A GOVERNMENT MUST SUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR PARTY. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT IF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WORKS IN UNISON, AS IT HAS BEEN DOING, THEN ALL MEMBERS OF THE LIBERAL PARTY WILL BE HAPPY TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARTY TO GUARANTEE A NEW VICTORY. (GIRON) WOULD YOU SUPPORT REFORMS TO THE ELECTORAL LAW? (AZCONA) WE DISCUSSED THAT ISSUE TODAY. APPARENTLY THE NATIONAL CONVENTION, WHICH IS THE PARTY'S TOP AUTHORITY, HAS APPROVED SOME REFORMS. (GIRON) DO YOU AGREE WITH INTERNAL ELECTIONS TAKING PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY (AS HEARD)? (AZCONA) I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IF THEY TAKE PLACE IN ONE SINGLE DAY, BUT WE DID NOT DISCUSS THAT TODAY, AND I DO NOT WANT TO DISCUSS DETAILS ABOUT THAT. (GIRON) DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EITHER YOUR GOVERNMENT OR YOURSELF COULD HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY HARMED BY THE LATEST CRISIS ENDURED BY THE COUNTRY? (AZCONA) I DO NOT THINK SO. I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED WILL BENEFIT THE COUNTRY. ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE REGRETTABLE, BUT THOSE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE IN HONDURAS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO VIOLENCE. THE SAME DAY INCIDENTS WERE TAKING PLACE HERE, 13 PERSONS DIED IN SAN SALVADOR AS A RESULT OF A BOMB EXPLOSION. THE LOSS OF LIVES IS UNFORTUNATE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST A BUILDING AND FACILITIES NEXT TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IS REGRETTABLE BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT HELP THE COUNTRY. (GIRON) HAVE YOU TALKED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ABOUT AN INDEMNITY? IT IS BEING SAID THAT DAMAGE AMOUNTS TO $6 MILLION. (AZCONA) NO, WE HAVE NOTHING ABOUT $6 MILLION. WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS A NOTE FROM THE U.S. AMBASSADOR THE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENTS. THEY ARE ENTITLED TO FILE A PROTEST. THE NOTE SAYS THAT LATER THERE WILL BE A (WORDS INDISTINCT). HONDURAS SIGNED THE GENEVA CONVENTION ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENTS WHEN ACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT AGAINST DIPLOMATIC INSTALLATIONS. (GIRON) THE FORCING OF RADIO STATIONS TO JOIN A RADIO NETWORK AND THE IMPOSING OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF MUCH CRITICISM AGAINST YOUR GOVERNMENT. (AZCONA) I HAVE HEARD SOME CRITICISM BECAUSE OF THE NETWORK. PERHAPS WE HAD IT FOR A FEW HOURS TOO MANY. REGARDING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED POSITIVELY BECAUSE ONE MORE CASUALTY WOULD HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO COOL DOWN, AND THOSE ON THE STREETS RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES. I FEEL IT WAS BENEFICIAL. THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY DECREE WAS BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION AND ON PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY. CONGRESS WAS INFORMED ABOUT THIS. I BELIEVE THIS WAS A POSITIVE MEASURE, AND THIS IS HOW THE PEOPLE HAVE VIEWED IT, POSITIVELY. (GIRON) DO YOU BELIEVE THE SITUATION HAS BEEN OVERCOME? (AZCONA) WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE SITUATION IS OVER. I THINK SO. I BELIEVE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT TEMPERS GOT HOT FOR A MOMENT, AND THAT SOME SECTORS, WHICH I DO NOT WANT TO NAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE PEOPLE, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE TRIED TO MAKE POLITICAL GAINS AND THE SITUATION GOT OUT OF HAND. I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EVERYTHING IS MORE OR LESS QUIET. THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING WITH THE VARIOUS SECTORS. THERE IS A SMALL STRIKE BY A SMALL GROUP OF HEALTH WORKERS. CHECKS WITH SALARY INCREASES COVERING A 4-MONTH PERIOD WILL BE PAID TODAY. SOME READJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE TO FAVOR SOME EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE INCREASES WE HAD PROMISED. WE WANT TO APPEAL TO HEALTH SECTOR LABOR UNIONS TO SET ASIDE ANY CONFRONTATIONAL ATTITUDE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS MEETING AND WILL MEET ALL ITS COMMITMENTS. (GIRON) WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE LATEST INCIDENTS WITH NICARAGUA? (AZCONA) THESE ARE NOT THE FIRST INCIDENTS. I BELIEVE INCIDENTS WILL CONTINUE HAPPENING. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO ENFORCE RESPECT FOR THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY. (END RECORDING)",

THE GREEN CROSS IS SERVING AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR DMIFA (ARMED FORCES ENGINEERS' MILITARY DETACHMENT) TO DISLODGE THE POPULATION. SOME DMIFA AGENTS ARE WEARING GREEN CROSS UNIFORMS TO DO THAT JOB. THEY GO FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE, IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES WITH GREEN CROSS DOCUMENTS. THEY ARE ASKING FAMILIES ONE BY ONE TO MOVE OUT, TELLING THEM THAT THOSE AREAS WILL BE BOMBED. WE URGE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE RED CROSS, THE GREEN CROSS, AND RESCUE TEAMS NOT TO PERMIT THE USE OF INSIGNIAS, UNIFORMS, AND VEHICLES OF HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS BY ARMY TROOPS. THE DISLODGING OF PEOPLE IN SAN SALVADOR AND NOW IN THE 27 DE SEPTIEMBRE NEIGHBORHOOD IN ZACATECOLUCA IS BEING DONE IN ORDER TO PROCEED WITH THE BOMBING OF THESE DENSELY POPULATED CIVILIAN NEIGHBORHOODS.",

ON THIS OCCASION I AM DEEPLY MOVED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE, AND, IN MY ROLE AS DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTER, I HEARTILY CONGRATULATE THEM. THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE HAS REFLECTED THEIR STOICISM, STRONG WILL, AND INDOMITABLE SPIRIT, HOPE, AND FAITH IN GOD AND THE ARMED FORCES. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, YOUR ATTITUDE IN RECENT DAYS HAS BEEN DIGNIFIED AND IT HAS SET AN EXAMPLE. IT IS WORTHY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE ALWAYS PROVED THEIR FAITH AND WILLINGNESS TO DEFEND A JUST AND NOBLE CAUSE, THE HOMELAND'S CAUSE. THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HAS GIVEN THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE THE WILL TO LIVE, LOVE, AND ACHIEVE PEACE. YOUR ATTITUDE ENCOURAGES US, PLACES US UNDER AN OBLIGATION, AND URGES US -- AS AN INSTITUTION AT THE SERVICE OF THE PEOPLE -- TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE TO THE END, SO THAT WE MAY ERADICATE FOREVER THE TERROR, VIOLENCE, AND DISRESPECT THAT THE TERRORIST FORCES HAVE TRIED TO IMPOSE ON OUR HARD-WORKING AND INNOCENT PEOPLE. SALVADORAN PEOPLE, YOUR ATTITUDE IS EXEMPLARY, AND WE, THE PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS, ARE PREPARED -- LIKE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN -- TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN ANY EVENT THE SECURITY, ORDER, TRANQUILLITY, WORK, AND PEACE THAT ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO ENJOY. ONWARD, SALVADORAN PEOPLE. AS AN INSTITUTION WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT. YOUR SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS NECESSARY. YOU MUST BELIEVE IN AND TRUST THE ARMED FORCES, BECAUSE WE, WHO ARE ALSO PEOPLE LIKE YOU, UNDERSTAND THE LEGITIMATE DEMAND AND DESIRE FOR PEACE, FAITH, AND HOPE WHICH PREVAIL IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF ALL SALVADORAN CITIZENS -- AND WE ARE PLEASED AND SATISFIED TO DEFEND THEM. THE ARMED FORCES ARE AN INSTITUTION WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GUARANTEEING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S WELFARE, AND THEY ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED, DEEPLY PLEASED, AND DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK. THEY WILL DEFEND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND GUARANTEE THEM A FUTURE WITH DIGNITY, PEACE, WELFARE, AND SECURITY. (CONTINUED)",

A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, AND BROADCAST BY RADIO VENCEREMOS INDICATES THAT THE INSURGENT FORCES THIS MORNING PENETRATED PERIPHERAL NEIGHBORHOODS OF SAN SALVADOR. THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO SAYS THAT HEAVY FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE NEAR THE SAN BENITO POLICE BARRACKS, THE ZONA ROSA, THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, AND THE INTERNATIONAL FAIR. RADIO VENCEREMOS REPORTS THAT FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR; IT ALSO DENOUNCED THE DEATH OF MANY CIVILIANS DUE TO THE INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S AIR FORCE. ACCORDING TO INSURGENT RADIO VENCEREMOS THE PRESENCE OF THE GUERRILLA FORCES IN THE MAIN CITIES OF THE COUNTRY HAS ENCOURAGED POPULAR UPRISINGS AND THE GROWING PARTICIPATION OF THE POPULATION IN THE STRUGGLE. THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE REBEL UNITS CONTINUE FIGHTING THE ARMY IN SEVEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE COUNTRY.",

THE FIRST THING THE GOVERNMENT DID WAS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS BASES TO WAGE A STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS WITH WHATEVER FIRMNESS AND PERSEVERANCE WAS CALLED FOR. WE STRENGTHENED INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, WE CREATED SPECIAL PUBLIC COURTS. WE MODIFIED PENAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES. WE INTRODUCED NEW MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND TO PROTECT CITIZENS. WE FORMED NEW COMPONENTS TO BOLSTER OUR PUBLIC FORCES. OUR EFFORTS TOOK QUITE A BIT OF TIME. ONE CANNOT PROVIDE AN OVERNIGHT SOLUTION FOR THESE COMPLEX PROBLEMS WITH WHICH YOU ARE ALL VERY FAMILIAR. ONCE THE INSTITUTIONS IN CHARGE OF MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY WERE STRENGTHENED, WE CONCENTRATED OUR AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON SOLVING THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY POSITIVE, BOTH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING -- WHICH IS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF MANY OF THESE TERRORIST GROUPS -- AND IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND PRIVATE JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS, ALSO KNOWN AS DEATH SQUADS. NEVER BEFORE HAD WE ACHIEVED SUCH POSITIVE RESULTS. I AM SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WILL FACE DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES, WE WILL CONTINUE TO WIN THIS BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM. TO DATE, WE HAVE DISBANDED 23 GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS OPERATING IN ENVIGADO IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, HUICAN IN BOYACA DEPARTMENT, PUERTO LOPEZ AND SAN MARTIN IN META DEPARTMENT, LA ROCHELA IN SANTANDER DEPARTMENT, AND LLANOS DEL YARI IN CAQUETA DEPARTMENT. THESE GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS HAD PARTICIPATED IN MOST OF THE MURDERS OF THE COUNTRY'S LEFTIST LEADERS. (CONTINUED)",

        "text": "GENERAL HECTOR GRAMAJO MORALES HAS REPORTED THAT LAST NIGHT'S TERRORIST ACTS WERE PROBABLY INTENDED TO DAMAGE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS, BUT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WENT OFF PREMATURELY. HE ADDED THAT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HIT A WALL OF THE AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS AND THE SHOCK WAVE FROM THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED SOME BUILDINGS. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS, THE ATTACK WAS PROBABLY A PROPAGANDA PLOY BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE RUDIMENTARY AND SIMILAR TO FIRECRACKERS. THE TERRORIST ACTIONS SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE IRREGULAR GROUPS ARE SHRINKING CONSIDERABLY. EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT A SUBVERSIVE WHO SURRENDERED ON THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS CARRYING SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD MADE A BIG EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR PRESENCE, BUT THAT NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL RESULTED AND THEY SUFFERED MANY CASUALTIES INSTEAD, GRAMAJO SAID. WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS ON THE TALKS BEING HELD IN OSLO, NORWAY, GRAMAJO SAID THAT THOSE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THE TALKS DO NOT MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THE GROUPS THAT CARRY OUT THE TERRORIST ACTIONS. AMONG THOSE GROUPS, THERE IS ONE FACTION THAT IS CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL MILITANT GROUP. THIS FACTION IS COMPRISED OF PERSONS WHO LOVE ADVENTURE; THESE PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS TO ENGAGE IN SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES.",

THE REPORT ON THE PLOT WAS INITIALLY CARRIED BY CHANNEL FOUR DURING A POLITICAL PROGRAM. IT WAS LATER PICKED UP BY THE CENTER-RIGHT WING NEWSPAPER EXPRESO, ONE OF THE LEADING NEWSPAPERS IN THE COUNTRY. ALVARO VARGAS LLOSA, A SON AND SPOKESMAN FOR THE PERUVIAN WRITER, STATED THAT \"WE GIVE GREAT CREDENCE TO THE DOCUMENT SHOWN ON TELEVISION BUT THE AUTHORITIES SEEM TO HAVE IGNORED IT. IT CONCERNS MY FATHER AND IT SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.\" ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT, THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHICH HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY DENIED BY THE NAVY, AN MRTA HIT SQUAD WOULD MURDER THE NOVELIST AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT (FREDEMO) AND OTHER PERSONALITIES OF THE CENTER-RIGHT WING COALITION. THE REPORT ADDS THAT THE PLOT MAY HAVE BEEN CONCOCTED EARLY IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR AT A MEETING REPORTEDLY ATTENDED BY PRESIDENT GARCIA, INTERIOR MINISTER AGUSTIN MANTILLA, TWO SENIOR LEADERS OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA), AND BY AN UNIDENTIFIED MRTA MEMBER.",

TWO MEMBERS OF THE AEU COORDINATING BOARD, WHO LAST WEEK WENT INTO EXILE, SAID THAT IT IS URGENT THAT A PERMAMENT UN RAPPORTEUR BE SENT TO GUATEMALA TO CERTIFY THE CONTINUAL AND INCREASING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE COUNTRY. THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ALSO CALLED FOR GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO SEND DELEGATIONS TO GUATEMALA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, \"TO PRESSURE THE VINICIO CEREZO GOVERNMENT TO STOP THE CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AND THE BLOODBATH BEING PREPARED BY THE ARMY TO CONTAIN THE STUDENT AND PEOPLES' MOVEMENTS.\" THE AEU REPRESENTATIVES SAID THEY HAD EVIDENCE THAT THE RECENT KIDNAPPING OF 12 STUDENT LEADERS, OUT OF WHICH 5 WERE LATER FOUND MURDERED WITH BRUTAL SIGNS OF TORTURE, \"WAS DIRECTLY PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMY. THESE SAME STUDENTS BELIEVE THAT VINICIO CEREZO'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT \"KNOWS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAMPAIGN OF TERROR, AND IT WILL NOT TAKE ACTION BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS AN ACCOMPLICE OF THE MILITARY.\" THE AEU LEADERS, WHO DID NOT DARE GIVE THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES \"COULD SUFFER WORSE CONSEQUENCES IN GUATEMALA,\" INSISTED THAT \"THE ONLY THING REMAINING FOR GUATEMALANS TO FACE THE TERROR AND VIOLENCE IS INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY.\" \"THE SITUATION IS TERRIBLE. THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTOR HIMSELF TOLD US THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING TO CONTAIN THIS WAVE OF REPRESSION AND ADVISED US THAT WE BETTER SEEK INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE,\" ONE OF THE EXILED AEU LEADERS SAID. ACCORDING TO THEM, THE WAVE OF REPRESSION OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AGAINST GUATEMALAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS \"IS THE WORST SINCE 1978,\" WHEN NUMEROUS UNIVERSITY LEADERS WERE MURDERED, INCLUDING AEU SECRETARY GENERAL OLIVERIO CASTANEDA, KILLED AT POINT-BLANK RANGE WHILE HEADING A DEMONSTRATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAPITAL. CASTANEDA'S MURDER FORCED THE AEU TO ELIMINATE THE POST OF SECRETARY GENERAL AND MODIFY ITS STRATEGIES SO ITS TOP LEADERS WOULD NOT BECOME EASY TARGETS OF REPRESSION. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE LATEST EVENTS, THESE CHANGES SEEM TO HAVE HAD LITTLE EFFECT. \"BECAUSE NOW THEY CANNOT IDENTIFY ANY PARTICULAR LEADER TO KILL, LIKE THEY DID WITH OLIVERIO, THIS TIME THEY HAVE ATTACKED US ALL,\" ONE OF THE BANISHED LEADERS , WHO ARRIVED IN COSTA RICA LAST WEEKEND, SAID. SINCE 21 AUGUST, WHEN THE CAMPAIGN OF STUDENT KIDNAPPINGS AND MURDERS BEGAN, OF THE 16 MEMBERS OF THE AEU EXECUTIVE COORDINATING BOARD, THREE WERE MURDERED, SEVEN ARE STILL MISSING, FOUR HAD TO GO INTO HIDING, AND TWO WENT INTO EXILE. \"I WAS TOLD THROUGH A FRIEND: YOUR TURN IS ON 4 SEPTEMBER. I THEN HAD TO HIDE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY,\" ONE OF THE EXILED TOLD AFP WITH ANGUISH. \"WE REALLY DID NOT EXPECT THIS. WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE POLITICALLY NEUTRALIZED, BUT NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD ORDER US KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED,\" ANOTHER OF THE STUDENTS ADMITTED. FOR BOTH LEADERS \"THE ARMY'S REPRESSIVE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE AEU SEEKS TO SCARE THE POPULATION AND STOP THE PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT THAT BECAME MOTIVATED FOLLOWING THE LAST TEACHERS' STRIKE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.\" HOWEVER, THEY CONCLUDED, \"THE ARMY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO END THE AEU BECAUSE TO DO SO THE ARMY WOULD HAVE TO KIDNAP, MURDER, OR SEND INTO EXILE THE 60,000 SAN CARLOS UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, THE LARGEST AND OLDEST UNIVERSITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA.\"",

AN ECOPETROL (COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE) SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT KM - 102 OF THE PIPE NEAR BENADIA IN ARAUCA INTENDANCY, IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. THIS ATTACK TAKES PLACE 25 DAYS AFTER A PREVIOUS GUERRILLA ACTION, WHICH INTERRUPTED THE PUMPING OF CRUDE THROUGH THE 780 - KM LONG PIPELINE. ON 16 JUNE, THE ELN DESTROYED THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS OIL TERMINAL ON COLOMBIA'S ATLANTIC COAST, IN WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE MOST SERIOUS ATTACK AGAINST COLOMBIA'S PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN ITS HISTORY. SINCE THAT TIME, COLOMBIA HAS BEEN FORCED TO SUSPEND AN AVERAGE OF 180,000 OF THE 220,000 DAILY BARRELS OF CRUDE PIPED THROUGH THE COUNTRY'S LEADING PIPELINE. TODAY'S ATTACK IS THE 25TH DURING 1989, AND THE THIRD THIS WEEK, THE ECOPETROL SPOKESMAN REVEALED. THE ELN'S ATTACKS HAVE REDUCED THE NATION'S HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION THIS YEAR BY 20 PERCENT, WITH LOSSES EXCEEDING $180 MILLION. THE ELN HAS DYNAMITED THE CANO LIMON-COVENAS PIPELINE 125 TIMES SINCE JANUARY 1988, CAUSING LOSSES OF MORE THAN $450 MILLION AS A RESULT OF OIL SPILLS, HALTED PRODUCTION, THE SUSPENSION OF EXPORTS, AND ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE, THE ECOPETROL SPOKESMAN ADDED. DURING THE 25 YEARS OF ITS ARMED STRUGGLE, THE ELN -- LED BY FORMER SPANISH PRIEST MANUEL PEREZ -- HAS INTENSIFIED ITS ATTACKS AGAINST THE PETROLEUM INFRASTRUCTURE, ARGUING THAT IT PERPETRATES THESE ACTIONS \"TO PREVENT THE EXPLOITATION OF COLOMBIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES.\"",
