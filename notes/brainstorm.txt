Open Questions:
- Are locations and dates always explicitly mentioned in the text?
  - Dates are given a dateline and articles often use deictic expressions to denote events' time of occurrence
  - For locations, the documentation says that "the country where the incident occurred may be explicit in the text or may have to be inferred"
- Do we necessarily want to take the values of these slots as answers to questions about event dates and times?
- Do we also want to include the "PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE" slot? My guess is yes.
- Do we also want to include the "PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY" slot (TERRORIST ACT vs. STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE)? Probably.
- Can we be confident that "irrelevant" documents (i.e. those without templates) are *actually* irrelevant given the ontology?
- How should relevancy be handled (i.e. the requirements that (1) events be *recent*, and (2) they occur in one of the countries of interest)
  - Should questions target "relevancy" properties as well?
- Should we maybe add template anchors too?
- **Big question: How faithful should we be to the original annotations as opposed to creating a resource that is more faithful to the text of the document?
- How should irrealis be handled?

Notes
- The slots to be included beyond the standard five are the following:
  - Perp: Incident category (terrorist act vs. state-sponsored violence)
  - Target: Effect of Incident
  - Victim: Effect of Incident
  - Incident: Location
  - Incident: Date
  - Incident: Stage of Execution

 7.6 SLOT 5--INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTION
   
  Applicability: Applicable to all types of incidents
  Number of fillers:  Always one filler per template
  Set list:
    ACCOMPLISHED
    ATTEMPTED
    THREATENED
  Note:  If a bomb is planted (by possible terrorists) but is detonated
    intentionally by authorities, an ATTEMPTED BOMBING template should
    be generated.

7.9 SLOT 8--PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY

  Applicability: Applicable to all types of incidents
  Number of fillers:  One filler per template, or NULL (hyphen) if
    nature of perpetrator cannot be determined.
  Set list:
    TERRORIST ACT
    STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE
  Notes: 
    1) TERRORIST ACT should be used when the perpetrator is *not* a
    member of the government/military/police.
    2) The subcategory of STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE should be used when 
    the perpetrator is a member of the government/military/police.
    3) This slot may be filled even if the perpetrators are not identified,
    if the text gives strong evidence for the category without providing
    any strings to fill the perpetrator slots; however, it will generally be
    the case that this slot is null if the perpetrator slots are null.

7.12 SLOT 11--PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENCE

  Applicability: Applicable to all types of incidents
  Number of fillers: Null if PERP: ORGANIZATION ID slot is null, 
    else one filler per filler in the PERP: ORGANIZATION ID slot.
  Cross-referencing:  Include cross-reference to PERP: ORGANIZATION ID.
  Set list:
    REPORTED AS FACT
    ACQUITTED
    CLAIMED OR ADMITTED
    SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED
      SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED BY AUTHORITIES
    POSSIBLE
  Notes:  
    1) Use REPORTED AS FACT as a default if the identity of the perpetrator 
    org and its responsibility for the incident appear not to be in question.
    2) Use SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED if the article explicitly expresses some
    degree of uncertainty about the identity of the perpetrator org, e.g., by
    use of qualifying words.
    This fill should also be used if the article's reporting rests on 
    suspicions or accusations expressed by some source cited by the
    article's originator or by the article's originator himself.
    3) Use SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED BY AUTHORITIES instead of SUSPECTED OR
    ACCUSED for cases where the article is conveying the information that 
    the government, military, police, or other authority figure
    is expressing the suspicion/accusation or is accepting/admitting guilt
    on behalf of another authority that has been identified as the 
    perpetrator org.  
    (In the latter case, where the perpetrator is himself an authority 
    figure, use CLAIMED OR ADMITTED if he admits/claims his own org's guilt.)
    4) Use POSSIBLE if an article mentions an organization in the context 
    of the incident without actually accusing that organization of being
    responsible for it.


7.17 SLOT 16--PHYS TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT: "the impact of an incident on a physical target"

| Applicability:  Not applicable to KIDNAPPING incidents
  Number of fillers:  Null, or one or more fillers.  The EFFECT slot may be
    filled in even if the ID/NUMBER/TYPE slots are all null (in the case
|   where the article makes no direction mention of the target but rather
|   refers to it indirectly by saying
    something in summary about damage).  Conversely, the EFFECT slot may
    be null even if the ID/NUMBER/TYPE slots are filled.
  Cross-referencing: Include cross-reference to PHYS TGT: ID;
    if that slot is null, generate a dummy cross-reference, e.g.,
    NO DAMAGE: "-".
  Set list:
    DESTROYED
    SOME DAMAGE
    NO DAMAGE
  Additional set list items for ROBBERY incidents:
    MONEY TAKEN FROM TARGET
    PROPERTY TAKEN FROM TARGET
    TARGET TAKEN
  Notes: 
    1) Use DESTROYED when the article indicates total destruction, as
    when it says that the target was "blown up" by a bomb.
    2) ARSON of a target implies at least SOME DAMAGE.  Other incident
    types, such as BOMBING, do not imply damage.


7.24 SLOT 23--HUM TGT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT: "the impact of an incident on a human target"

| Applicability:  Applicable to all types of incidents.
  Number of fillers:  Null, or one or more fillers.  The EFFECT slot may be
    filled in even if the NAME/DESCRIPTION/NUMBER/TYPE slots are all null 
    (in the case where the article makes no mention at all of any human 
    targets or unwitting victims but says something in summary about (lack
    of) victims).  Conversely, the EFFECT slot may be null even if the 
    ID/NUMBER/TYPE slots are filled.
  Cross-referencing: Include cross-reference to NAME slot if NAME slot
    is not NULL; else include cross-reference to DESCRIPTION slot.
    If both slots are null, generate a dummy cross-reference, e.g.,
    NO INJURY: "-".
| Set list for all incidents except KIDNAPPING, ATTEMPTED ATTACK,
|   and THREATENED ATTACK incidents:
      INJURY
      DEATH
      NO INJURY
      NO DEATH
      NO INJURY OR DEATH
  Set list for KIDNAPPING incidents, in addition to above list:
      REGAINED FREEDOM
| Set list for ATTEMPTED ATTACK:
      ESCAPED
      INJURY
      NO INJURY
| Set list for THREATENED ATTACK incidents:
      INJURY
      NO INJURY
      RESIGNATION (i.e., from job)
      NO RESIGNATION
